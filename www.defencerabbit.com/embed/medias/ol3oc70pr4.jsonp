So we approached UpGuard primarily from for our external, you know, security posture management. We wanted to understand how a tool can help us detect, if at all, there are any loopholes from the external world point of view and that way UpGuard was a very, very handy asset. I mean, one good thing which I like was you do not need to do any integration with your with your platform.\n\nYou just need to tell them that, hey, yes, you signed the agreement and they started, you know, scanning from outside in perspective and then they tell you the report very quickly, which is again, so helpful. And that way you you can define the action that, okay, these are the weak points, which tool is has detected and is telling me it gives you all the enough insights. Also like for example, I remember one of the hosts had bicycle port 3306 open. Now why would you open bicycle 3306 It was a test host I think created several years ago but still, right?\n\nI mean, why would you keep your 3306 port, which is bicycle port open for the world? Similarly, if there are SSL certificate related issues, the tool help you help us in fact detect those that here are, you know, these issues and also help us kind of categorize that. Okay, These are the critical vulnerabilities, these are the critical issues that you need to fix. So some kind of categorization that.\n\nOkay, how many of the overall or what percentage of your the issue that got reported falls under a critical high, medium and low, and that help us define the actions. And we were able to apply those fixes very, very quickly. Additionally, UpGuard also help us figure out the the the health of our any, you know, vendor tool that we are integrated, whether it is downstream or upstream. It tells you that as well that, hey, one of the tools or one of the vendors that you are integrated with your platform but that they are, you know, they are good or they're not so good from security posture point of view.\n\nSo that's an additional insight. Now there you may not take action immediately. Rather, you work with your vendors to say that, hey, here is a discovery that I have from from my tool-side and can you take action? Otherwise, I'll have to probably block you because it becomes an issue for you to operate in that model.\n\nSo one the last thing which I remember with UpGuard and I was pleasantly surprised that this tool actually helped us even figure out the subdomains within our master domain. So Games24x7.com is our master domain. And there were several subdomains where some fixes needed to be applied and the tool was able to detect those as well very, very quickly.\n\nAnd with that report and the recommendations, we were able to take actions, you know, very, very quickly. And that helped us improve the score overall from the external security posture management point of view."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"language":"","onByDefault":"false","on":"true","async":"false"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"language":"","onByDefault":"false","on":"true","async":"false"}},"vulcan":true}},"options":{}};
