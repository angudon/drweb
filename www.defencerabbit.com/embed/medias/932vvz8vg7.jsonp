My name is Annie, and I'm a Product Marketing Manager at UpGuard. In today's roughly evolving digital landscape, the security risks to businesses and third-party vendors are rapidly increasing, with the potential to compromise sensitive data and, in many cases, research findings and intellectual property as well. Now, more than ever, it is central for businesses to proactively identify cyber security threats and understand why robust, vendor-risk management strategies are required to address them.\n\nIn today's webinar, we'll be addressing these issues with a focus on the higher education industry. However, if you're not joining us from the higher education space, I know many of the risks and challenges we'll discuss today will be relevant for you. To begin, I'd like to introduce our speakers. Firstly, we have Steve LaVath.\n\nSteve is a Chief Information Security Officer for the Colorado State University System, having served in the primary cyber security role at Colorado State University for nearly 20 years. Steve is a PhD ABD in Public Communication and Technology, and holds a CI, SSP, and MS Information Security Assurance from Norwich University. Steve's very background allows him to bring a forward perspective to security conversations across the university environment, from research labs to classrooms to the boardroom. Thanks for joining us, Steve.\n\nThanks, Amy. And with Steve is Greg Pollock. Greg is a Vice President of Product for Upguard Research Site. He oversees the strategy, roadmap, and execution of Upguard's risk detection platform.\n\nHis team's research has been featured in publications such as The Washington Post, The New York Times, Forbes, CNN, and Bloomberg. Welcome, Greg. Hey. Yeah, thank you, Annie.\n\nBefore we get started, I'd like to let you know that if you have any questions for Steve and Greg throughout the session, please submit them via the Q\u0026A box to the right side of your screen. And I'll be back towards the end of the webinar to go through the questions with our speakers. And with that, I will now pass to Greg to begin the discussion on case other security risks. Yeah, great.\n\nYeah. Thank you, Annie. And, yeah, Steve, thanks for being here, of course. All right. Well, cool.\n\nYeah, so in actually developing this webinar and talking through with Steve and learning from him during it, I realized that probably a better subtitle would have been something like trying to do more with less because we're going to talk about how much there is to do and how there are finite resources. And again, like Annie said, this is, I think, very true for higher ed, but also, especially right now, for all industries, that there are budgetary constraints, resource constraints affecting everyone, as well as, yeah, a pretty nasty threat environment. So the kind of thing, if you're going to talk through today, really kind of are designed to deal with those factors.\n\nThen the threats that we see today, and then given that we have a lot we could do, almost an infinite number of things we could be doing, how can we target our resources and our efforts so that we get the most bang for our buck, so that we do the best we can given the situation we're in. So, yeah. First, we'll talk about, you know, sort of the nature of higher education. I think it's important to remember that because it is different than other industries, and it's important to, you know, just like threat actors and insurers, take into account the industry you're operating in, it's important to remember the context that we're operating as well.\n\nAnd then some of the challenges from having lots of assets to manage, all kinds of vulnerabilities, and then third party risk. And a few of the things that, again, I think can be done to get the most out of the solutions we address to those situations. So first, I mean, I think I hardly need to remind anyone of this, but, yeah, the threat environment, we're really since 2020-ish when the ransomware groups took off, we've seen that emerge as like a really pretty aggressive threat. And it's one that, I mean, Sophos put out a pretty good study in 2022 that I've cited two things from here that, yeah, we see it both in sort of surveys like this one.\n\nI see it in monitoring the ransomware groups directly. Higher education is one of the sectors that often gets targeted. And I thought the US cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency, the CSSA, even called out and had an advisory about threats to the education sector more broadly, that it is one where, yeah, there is a real threat. And then also I think like what's at stake is also something that's important to us as people, I mean, as practitioners, then, you know, who we're protecting matters.\n\nAnd then I think it's worth remembering that for students. And Steve, you, of course, are very involved in like thinking about and protecting student data. I was, yeah, I'm very curious to hear any observations you have in terms of the threats and how you all think about them. Yeah, Greg.\n\nI think it's important to remember that these surveys and the news about increasing rates of ransomware attacks and successful ransomware attacks are not just things that IT folks keep an eye on. These pieces of news are filtering to the boards of directors, board of governors. And so increasingly we are being asked what we're doing to protect students and our institutions and whether we can assure them that those protections are adequate to the task. So even if we are at an institution that historically didn't place a lot of faith in formal risk management because it was too much work or not effective given our strange market, we're being asked to analyze and report on our management of risks in a more formal and traditional way than maybe we've been into.\n\nSo I think this discussion is timely and valuable in terms of what our job space has turned into recently. Yeah, that's an interesting observation about, because something that you'll often hear among practitioners is that I see the problem, but I can't communicate it to my leadership and I can't get executive buy-in and it seems like in some ways, maybe not entirely changing, but at least you're saying the board of governors are aware of and want to know what we're doing. And I think part of that comes from the inherent risk in operating a higher education university. And actually, when we talk about this, what you said was so spot on that I wanted to have you talk first on this slide, because you said it better than I could have.\n\nSo how do you and I guess your team, your organization think about risk in your role? I think one of our former institutional leaders frequently was quoted as saying that nothing worth doing is without risk. And that's sort of a mindset that we take in our mission. We engage the frontiers of science and education and research where the rules aren't quite as set and where we're intentionally exploring some of the riskier areas.\n\nAnd so the freedom for faculty to teach and research outside the normal boxes is an important part of who we are. And so there's always been an appetite to push those risk boundaries. And so as our world has increasingly moved out onto the internet, both in interacting with researchers across institutions and then relying on third party platforms and products that risk appetite has spread beyond our carefully controlled borders. Yeah, I think that's so important for people to hear because so often you can get frustrated with wanting to make things more secure and then sort of like, well, if I could remove the users, then it would be perfectly secure.\n\nBut I think it's so important to remember that the reward, the risk is there to a calculated risk. And the reward of universities of higher education is so important to our society and to technology and progress in all of these things. And yeah, there also is just like to be able to have a student body. You have to intake an immense amount of personal information to be able to have students, have them role in classes, administer scholarships and so forth.\n\nAnd it's also on top of that, the research function. And that's where the graph here is one I thought was an interesting reminder of that for everyone. And so one of the leading sources of data leaks is people committing credentials or source code, et cetera, to GitHub, committing what should be private stuff to a public. And yeah, one of my teams is a data like research team.\n\nWe find credentials for all kinds of orgs, including universities on GitHub. But at the same time, when, you know, GitHub and open source software, code sharing, that's how, you know, yeah, all the wonderful things of open source software come from as well. And so when we looked at how many commits are there to GitHub in public repositories with associated email addresses, then the biggest and leading universities are by far committing the most public code. Now, does that increase risk of credential loss?\n\nAbsolutely. That's like one of the number one things we look for. But it also correlates with, you know, research advances. And so, yeah, I thought this metric is one that encapsulates both sides of the coin, that to advance research, then you also have to accept the risk that maybe things will go wrong in one way or another.\n\nAll right, so, yeah, so part of that, part of one of the things we see with universities is just a large attack surface. They're to provide services to students, to provide services to faculty, research, etc. That results in a lot of domains, IPs, etc. And this is one thing where, yeah, so this is a challenge, it's simply the more you have to manage, the more likely it is that you will miss something or something will be, you know, unmanage.\n\nAnd this, I guess I should have compared universities to other industries. And it totally, yeah, we see more assets on larger attack surface for universities. And just, I think the numbers here are, yeah, you can see hundreds to thousands of domains for universities. Yeah, I guess, Steve, like, yeah, how do you approach your attack surface?\n\nI think one of the biggest challenges in higher ed is that, by and large, most of our, particularly they are larger institutions, are pretty heavily distributed in the IT management world. At my university, the IT function grew up out of existing practices in a variety of departments, notably math and statistics and physics and engineering. And they all have their freestanding technology domains until we merged some of them together. But they retain the value that they place in running their own systems that are unique to their needs and their research areas.\n\nAnd so what we end up with is a lot of public facing IPs and domains applications that we don't necessarily run centrally. And so multiply a typical organizational footprint by the number of distributed IT units that you have. Yeah. And you have a recipe for a pretty large attack surface to keep track of.\n\nYeah. One of the things I observe, both from the data leaks perspective and then from our automated scanning perspective, yeah, you'll find the CS dot whatever the domain is. And there will be all kinds of stuff there and many sub domains of CS dot, you know, university.edu. And yeah, I think it's important also, like, you can then have some organizational oversight with the dot notation structure of, okay, who generally does this belong to.\n\nBut then, yeah, people can stand things up and move them around and change how they're configured. Yeah. It just seems like a, yeah, it is a challenge. And so let's see, oh, yeah, and this was one of the resulting challenges from that is when there are so many assets that are distributed in responsibility, then these issues can creep in.\n\nI'll be at a much smaller rate. So in the previous graph, then, you know, the, we went up to, you know, 1000, 2000 domains, a relatively small number of those will have these issues that may be points for intervention. But I do think it's noteworthy. Yeah.\n\nAs you have, you know, more assets, then some percent, you know, 5% to 1% will have these things that you want to detect on them, whether they're known, exploitable, vulnerabilities and device software, other kinds of issues. These are the things that can slip in when you have more to manage. Sorry, I'm going to go, I'm going to go one more. This is what I wanted to get to is, yeah, attack service reduction.\n\nSomeone else came up with this name. I think it's a great idea. If you have a lot of stuff to manage, make your life easier, simplify it, have less stuff. I'm actually, I'm actually going through moving my family right now and getting rid of my kid stuff, getting rid of a bunch of their toys will make it much easier to pack.\n\nI think it's the same idea. This is one of the things that you have observed looking at these really expansive university footprints where truly, like, no one could go through and audit every single one of a thousand domains. But if you could pick out features that maybe make them good candidates for attack service reduction to simplify that, then that is a way to get started with this problem, you know, to rather than try to boil the ocean. The two of the things I looked at, there's a category we call Unmaintained Pages or Unmaintained Sites.\n\nIt's kind of the criteria are a mixture of things from serving default server pages. That's not really a useful site if you're giving me the Tomcat page or the index pages of 404. Why is that? One of the things I observed, so this graph on the left, the light blue bar is the total number for each of these groupings of universities, and the dark blue is the percentage.\n\nThe percentage is relatively consistent, so kind of anyone running in a large environment looks like they'll have, you know, a few percentage of these sites that may be ones where you can go find the owner and ask, can we maybe turn this off? And the same thing with the graph on the right is, okay, so on average, across all those universities, we see 200 odd domains, and of those, yeah, a small percentage are running in-device software, or on Unmaintained Pages, other indicators that there may be things you could do without. I don't know, yes. What kind of questions do you have when you engage with other, I guess, stakeholders in the university?\n\nRight. Well, you know, we have turn in personnel and technology, and it's not always easy to keep up with all the changes, you know, in a timely fashion, if someone maintaining a site leads, or if a program abandoned a site, it may still be up for a while, and no one bothered to tell us, and so having an automated way to look at the attack surface is a great way with things like Unmaintained Pages or End of Life applications that may just have been abandoned. When those get flagged, it gives me the chance to just shoot a quick message to one of the departmental IT managers and say, hey, is this still a going concern?\n\nIs it something we ought to get rid of? This would be a low-hanging piece of fruit to increase our security to the world, and they're usually pretty responsive to that kind of approach. Yeah. Yeah, your mind me of something that I should have said, but I didn't, which is the first step is having an asset inventory.\n\nSo even knowing what all of your domains are takes some effort, and I mean, there are many tools or open-source tools and free tools, yeah, that is not a given that you would know about every site, and then, yeah, this is triggering memories of seeing, like, finding data exposures, and then it's for some student event in 2016, where, yeah, like you said, all of those students, everyone who built that site have moved on, but the system is still running because no one turned it off. Or in some cases, someone did turn it off because it was running Windows XP, and we told them we couldn't run it.\n\nBut it was still sitting there in a desk, and then they needed an extra workstation for projects, so they turned it back on four years later, and all of a sudden, ah-ha, there's a Windows XP by a million. Yeah. Well, cool. So, yeah, I think the first thing is just knowing what you have, trying to find anything that can be printed off of it, the second challenge is sort of the more pointed problem with having lots of assets is that some of those assets are not just, like, squirrely, but some of them are vulnerable to attacks, and one of the challenges is that there is always a growing body of old vulnerabilities, which can still be exploited, call out RDP as just the golden oldie, but then also, like, the known exploited vulnerabilities, that category, and this is published by CSUB, that group includes both zero days, and then, you just see CVEs going back to 2008, so there's a, yeah, always, like, an ever-increasing body of vulnerabilities to manage, I mean, I guess in the last couple of weeks, then the paper cut to vulnerability has probably been, like, it does surprisingly, that's the name of the software, not the name of the vulnerability, it sounds like that's the name of the problem.\n\nBut, yeah, like, yeah, there's always something new, and frankly, like, pretty pressing, and yeah, so this is, it seems like, yeah, a challenge to deal with both cleaning up all of the old stuff, and then also, you know, when it's time to jump for a zero day, being able to pivot very quickly, I don't know if you have any thoughts on how you balance that. Yeah, you mentioned the notion of an inventory from the hardware perspective, it's pretty critical to have some sort of idea of what's actually running on your network, not only from the hardware, but from the software perspective, so that when a zero day comes out, or when something pops on the known exploited vulnerabilities list, you know, whether to burn time out on it, or whether you can just shrug and move on, because there's a lot of traffic on those lists.\n\nYeah, vulnerabilities just keep coming, and yeah, so some sort of formal or informal sense of what you have, and that depends a lot on you, but that'll save you a lot of time. Yeah, and I think, yeah, what you said, like, it's going to be a question of triaging, and they're going to be things that you have to ignore things, and then there are other things you have to jump on, and so, yeah, being able to know this is the thing to put resources against is, yeah, the best you can do. And so, yeah, so that's, well, I guess I started saying what I was going to say here anyway, which is, yeah, being able to identify out of your inventory, where are the points of intervention, and, again, I call this out because, yeah, change management is never easy.\n\nI, you know, as a, the product manager at UpGuard, and the same thing is true with, you know, developing software as with maintaining assets that, yeah, change involves other people, and that's where the world gets complicated. And so, yeah, like you said, like being able to have an easy point of outreach either because I think you're not using this, can we turn it off, or this is egregiously out of band with our policies, we need to turn it off now, is a way to, to deal with that reality of, yeah, a dynamic threat environment. And, yeah, so, yeah, so, here I just sort of put in context the, so an average number of domains across all these universities, and then these three categories of things.\n\nSo known exploitable vulnerabilities, again, like a fairly small number of vulnerabilities are exploited, and then those are present on systems at a fairly low rate as well. But being able to deal with that fact that, you know, it sort of only takes one, yeah, having an inventory just like you said, so that you can intervene in a timely manner. I think it's probably the, the best you can do as far as dealing with that, that reality. Right.\n\nAll right, cool, and so, moving right along. So after managing all of your stuff, then you also have your third parties. And yes, Steve has, yes, so, see, so then you get to look after all of this, right? Both, yeah, your stuff and your vendors.\n\nYeah, this is a growing issue across our EDU space, and also a growing responsibility in terms of audits and board mandates and compliance is taking some control over the risk of connecting to other organizations, particularly when you have automated interactions that can reach into your network, or when they're hosting sensitive information, or when they might send email that could be suspect, either legitimately on your behalf to your users or to your admins claiming to need to need to get in to maintain something. So we're actively working on formalizing an IT vendor risk management program at CSU.\n\nAnd so this is a big area of focus for us right now. And in much the same way that it's a resource challenge to do formal risk management for our own stuff, it's an incredibly tall order to do full risk management on the broad world of all of our vendors, including the Microsofts and Amazons of the world. So we need a way to rein in the scope of what we're doing and make the most important visibility easy to get and then do a documentation we can and that the vendors are willing to do. Yeah, the extent of risk that third parties pose to really to any organization is of course like vendor risk management is not brand new, it's been around.\n\nBut like you said, it has acquired a growing importance in recent years. And I think one of the things that has triggered that are really cyber vendor risk management, not just the sort of the financial risk, but what is our cyber risk here, is the data leaks from ransomware groups where I do this with my team, there's a leak either or data they have taken and exposed intentionally, either from a university or from arbitrary groups around the world. And then you can see exactly how much data is transferred between their customers and whoever it was that was attacked and see, yeah, you can really see that a third party breach, it's not academic, a third party breach contains your data, your student data.\n\nAnd I've seen this in a few, not, not threat actor things, but true data leaks unintentional exposures of data from university vendors. And it's always astonishing how much data they have. So there's one that was a Greek sorority fraternity management app. And again, university students have to apply for so many things.\n\nEven if there aren't that many people getting into these fraternities, then this relatively small app had a million people's data with their driver's licenses and all this stuff. And there's, yeah, the same thing for all the, there's another one that's like a scholarship application. And the same like people apply for so many scholarships and do all this submission of personal information that even a relatively minor vendor may be collecting lots of student data or holding student data from a variety of institutions. Yeah, so one of the ways that using, using UpGuard, using our software to analyze vendors, we use their risk rating and then sort of compared that to, you know, broke that down by their, by how good or bad they are.\n\nAnd one of the things that was interesting is that, you know, so over there on the left is the university average, you know, decent, same thing for the average vendor, maybe decent. There's a, again, like you, as we get to the riskier vendors, then how risky they are greatly increases. So I think what you said is like a great bimodal approach of using Google and Microsoft and they're going to provide you probably all the information that they will, you know, somewhere on their website, being able to get through that assessment without sinking too much time into it. But then also trying to understand, okay, these vendors, you know, they're going to use vendors, a small number of vendors pose a great amount of risk, but then how much risk is that actually to us?\n\nWhat data do they have? Sorry, I kind of, I feel like I was kind of rambling there. But yeah, I think, I've been thinking a lot about this even since we started preparing for this webinar and I think that the concept of risk surface reduction is a good one to think about in terms of third parties as well and that has a lot more to do with the kind and amount of data that you let them have and how long you let them keep it. So from that perspective, the work that our privacy folks are doing, whether to comply with GDPR or the increasing number of state privacy laws, we can work hand in hand with those people in our institutions to think about can we figure out a way for these third-party cyber vendors to be keeping less of our data in the first place, limiting the amount that we're giving them to only what they need and requiring that they dump it after a reasonable amount of time.\n\nYes, yes. This is something that, again, examining the data released by a ransomware group, it makes such a big difference whether they've kept every piece of data for the last 15 years and now it's all exposed versus not keeping sensitive data they don't need. So again, I think there's some good news here. I think there's, well, not a solution, but it's something that can help us manage that problem more effectively.\n\nSo the HECVET, the Higher Education Community Vendor Assessment Tool, is a security questionnaire targeted to higher education use cases. And on the website for the RAN ISAC working group that does this, then they have a list of universities who are engaged with it as well as a list of vendors who have submitted to like a shared pool their own assessments using it that's called the Community Broker Index. That's the CBI as that group of vendors. And I think this is generally a great idea, having standards, asking those questions, are you, what data do you have?\n\nAre you retaining it, using questionnaires to get those key pieces of information back from a vendor about their practices? And I thought it was cool to compare the different populations here. So universities who are signed on using the HECVET questionnaire tend to have a little bit better security than those who don't. I think the causal relation is probably just that if you are investing in security thinking about it, asking those questions of others and you ask them of yourself, it's a good chance that their leadership is also engaged with the use of that.\n\nAnd yeah, having those conversations about what is our position and how can we meet what we think we should be at? And then the same for, well, a much more dramatic difference in the vendors. The vendors who have submitted these questionnaires are quite a bit more secure than those vendors who are not. So I think it's probably, again, an effective mechanism, but also a way to effectively manage resources to say this vendor has preemptively submitted a HECVET.\n\nWe can assess them quickly and determine how much risk they pose to us so that we don't over-invest in assessing Google or Microsoft or whatever and instead have time for these other vendors who maybe have not been asked those questions. I don't know if you have any further thoughts on information sharing in the, you're on the inside. Yeah, you're in the whatever, yeah, information sharing groups. Right.\n\nThe RENI SEC in general is a marvelous tool for security and risk management across higher than I would strongly encourage anybody who isn't already a member to have some representation there. If for no other reason than the constant threat awareness of what's coming down the road. In particular, the HECVET, the supporting that tool is a great community resource and there is a RENI SEC resource called the Community Broker Index. That's a list of vendors that have voluntarily agreed to provide the HECVET on request.\n\nAnd so you can look at a list and contact a designated resource at that company and really smooth the process along. I think that the vendor market, at least the somewhat larger and more mature vendors that want higher ed as a customer have seen the writing on the wall and decided that the HECVET is a decent thing to spend time filling out so that they can say, yes, new higher ed who is interested in us, we do this and we're happy to share. As with most compliance questionnaires, the smaller EDU groups and the smaller vendors have a resource constraint in terms of spending time doing all the things, so maybe not all of them have gone down this road, but we found it to be a really good resource.\n\nAll right, cool, I think we're right on time for any questions. Yeah, cool, Annie, hey, good to see you again. Thanks, Greg and Steve, I found that discussion very interesting, so I hope everyone knows standard as insightful as I did. As Greg said, let's move on to the Q\u0026A portion of the webinar.\n\nI've noticed during Greg and Steve sessions, there have been a few questions that have come in from the audience, there is still time to submit questions, so if you do have a question for us, please do so in the Q\u0026A box, so you're right. So in terms of the questions, let's see, there's one that has come in from anonymous, just so the audience is aware, feel free to add your name, if you feel comfortable doing that back in the state, if you want to be anonymous as well, this doesn't ask, what are some key components of vendor risk management I should be aware of, particularly within higher education?\n\nFor this one, I might throw to you, first, Greg, what are your thoughts on that? I was going to go to Steve because he's a guy, well, I think one of the things we touched on is, yeah, what data is being transferred between them and being able to, ideally, during like a vendor intake process, get some classification of your vendors at that point in time. So what access, network access, physical access, what kind of access will they have, so then you can target your resources based on that and in the worst case scenario, then you have that for incident response and you know, well, this is what could have happened given a breach of this vendor, but then, yeah, knowing not just, you know, network access, but yeah, data transmission, what are you going to be sending them, what are they going to be holding on your behalf and being able to hear them and then assess them and assess your risk based on that information about that relationship?\n\nRight, and I think, Greg, you mentioned the moment where you actually have some power to figure all that out and set up some understandings and some boundaries is at the contract negotiation. So whatever you can do to integrate with your procurement area to set up some approvals, maybe you don't need CSO approval every time you're going to buy a computer mouse or keyboard, but at a certain level of either expense or criticality of data or internal access from the vendor network, you ought to set up a process by which part of the procurement process is checking in with security and then combine that with some contract language that you're comfortable with in terms of enforcing your preferred practices or complying with a certain kind of baseline and maybe enforcing a heck of that either in its heck, that light implementation or the full document, depending on how sensitive the data is that they'll be hosting.\n\nSo getting all of that formalized in a program that's written down so you can get board support for it and defend it when people want to buy things that don't quite measure up is an important issue. And then you're from then on after the procurement moment, then you can focus on sort of the last mile, your interaction with them and the things that you can monitor and control, not so much knowing about their back end processes, but more the interface that they're giving to you in terms of human and technical interaction that you can watch. Thanks. Some of you have very important definitely valid points there, thanks for agency.\n\nAnother question that has come through is, this is a quite interesting one, it's within the education space, but I guess a subset of it, this doesn't zap, I've read that the online or e-learning market is growing rapidly, some stats I've seen say that it is expected to grow to over $370 billion by 2026, would you say that cyber risks you've mentioned today are still relevant for that industry? Steve, I might start with you sir, for this one. I'll just let you know that I got a master's in a 100% online program back in 2004. So it's been a space that's been active for a while, I think it has grown substantially and the global pandemic accelerated the number of people who are participating in it, as well as the number of schools who are engaging in it.\n\nSo remote learning as well as remote workers are an increasingly important sector. And when you're sitting at home interacting with more and more commonly SaaS based applications, you're sitting outside the moat, as it were, you're no longer protected by the castle walls, where most of our historical tools reside. And so risk management, particularly third party risk management becomes really important for the student learning at home, for the online education market. You need to figure out how you're going to manage the risks that come with individuals out on the internet interacting with applications out on the internet and vendors reaching back directly to those.\n\nSo probably new tools that are going to be involved and so assessing the risk and the sensitivity of information that the SaaS providers are holding is a newer and increasingly important area for sure. Yeah, beginning when you mentioned getting your degree online, it reminded me that at beginning of our research process that resulted in this, then we're collecting all this data about universities, and so we pull them, of course, like their name, domain, where this list has ranking, student body size, and one of the fields was do they offer remote learning? And as you can see, I didn't mention it before because it's like almost universal.\n\nSo it's like, yeah, is there a greater risk for the group that's offering remote learning? It doesn't matter. Basically all universities have some level of remote learning. I would say, yeah, again, like my data leaks work, then when you see a really big Elastic Search database, it's not uncommon for that to be for some kind of online tutoring thing.\n\nNot directly from a university or a school, but from a private group that is somehow hooked into education as a business. No, thanks, Greg, Steve. We are near the end of our webinar today. I think we have time for one more question, but if I ask Greg and Steve, we could just keep this response short.\n\nI know we have a lot to say about this whole topic in the industry, but this question comes from Vishal, who's asking, in your opinion, what are some common pain points in terms of security, the higher education institutes, I'm struggling with today. Steve might go to you first. I think that expense of scale is a huge pain point. That affects our ability to keep audit logs and be able to react to them.\n\nIt affects our ability to adequately back everything up and get it restored properly. As we make those sorts of defenses more comprehensive across our institution, the way vendors have marketed in the past makes that really expensive. What we end up with is very often partial coverage. One of the pain points is to be able, both from a check the audit box perspective, but also a comprehensive risk protection perspective is how do you assess whether you're protecting the right things well?\n\nI think the ability to look at your attack surface, your risk surface, and focus in on the really important pieces is crucial for being able to afford the right kind of protection. How about you, Greg? I've got nothing to add. I think it's exactly that.\n\nThere's a huge risk surface, attack surface, a huge amount to do, and it would be not practical, not feasible to defend it all. Just like Steve said, yeah, protect what's important well. Great. No, short and sweet.\n\nLove it. Yeah. Unfortunately, we have come to the end of our webinar today. If you would like to get in touch with any of us, Greg, Steve, or someone out of guard, please refer to the contact details on the screen.\n\nJust a very quick platform now, and we do have our quarterly up guard summit coming on May 31. If you want to hear about our latest product releases and valuable user insights, as well as learn best how to secure the risk management practices from peers and other industry leaders, please head to our website for more detail. Finally, I want to say thank you to Steve and Greg for sharing your thoughts with us today. Thank you for taking the time to join us, and I hope you have a great rest of the day.\n\nAll right. Thank you. All right, thank you."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"language":"","onByDefault":"false","on":"true","async":"false"},"hubspotForm":{"hubspotFormId":"a1e2e907-b2aa-4cd8-85ea-a8a0016df7dc","hubspotId":"228391","hubspotFormSeconds":"248","hubspotFormIsSkippable":"false","on":"true","hubspotFormEnabled":"true","hubspotFormHeaderText":"Want to learn more?"}},"vulcan":true,"branding":"false","showCustomerLogo":"false","customerLogoImageUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/1b2c11a64bb5009d0c284432cc3856f4.bin","customerLogoTargetUrl":"https://UpGuard.com","unalteredStillImageAsset":{"url":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/8633e10e6e25e062e7865cb89ef7e471.jpg","width":"2907","height":"1687"}},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"language":"","onByDefault":"false","on":"true","async":"false"},"hubspotForm":{"hubspotFormId":"a1e2e907-b2aa-4cd8-85ea-a8a0016df7dc","hubspotId":"228391","hubspotFormSeconds":"248","hubspotFormIsSkippable":"false","on":"true","hubspotFormEnabled":"true","hubspotFormHeaderText":"Want to learn more?"}},"vulcan":true,"branding":"false","showCustomerLogo":"false","customerLogoImageUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/1b2c11a64bb5009d0c284432cc3856f4.bin","customerLogoTargetUrl":"https://UpGuard.com","unalteredStillImageAsset":{"url":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/8633e10e6e25e062e7865cb89ef7e471.jpg","width":"2907","height":"1687"}}},"options":{}};
