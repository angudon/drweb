spreadsheets, are time-consuming and are difficult to scale as your vendor inventory grows over time.\n\nTo solve this problem, businesses must implement a scalable Vendor Risk Management (VRM)

morning, everyone, and welcome.\n\nThank you for joining us for today's webinar.\n\nMy name is Stuti Sharma, and I'll be the moderator for this event.\n\nAnd as we know, India is a global leader for booming our social industry,\n\nmaking Indian businesses a prime target for supply chains attacks.\n\nIn order to effectively manage third-party security risks,\n\nvendor risk management becomes the key function for any organization based in India.\n\nAnd so for today's topic, we'll dive deep into the importance of vendor risk management\n\nand learn how to better navigate the risk posed by these vendors.\n\nPlease feel free to drop your questions or even share your challenges and experiences in the chat box.\n\nWe answer your questions by the end of the presentation in our Q\u0026E section.\n\nI'd now like to introduce our speaker for today, Samya Mehta.\n\nSamya is the research sales director at UpGuard.\n\nShe has been with UpGuard for almost three years now,\n\nand has been helping organizations, particularly in India,\n\nprevent cyber risk and improve their cyber security posture.\n\nToday, Samya will talk about the best practices for vendor risk management\n\nand how Indian businesses can enhance their vendor risk management program.\n\nNow, without further ado, let's get started.\n\nOver to you, Samya.\n\nThanks, Phoebe, and thanks everyone who's tuned in today.\n\nAs you can see on the screen, the agenda for today,\n\nessentially, is that I'd be taking you through what vendor risk management means\n\nand how you can basically better be prepared for risks that's being took post\n\nby third-parties in your organization.\n\nA little bit about myself.\n\nI have been working with CISO, CIOs, and people in the infosex space in India\n\nover the last three years, and I've got a few of you that are here today as well.\n\nAnd it's very interesting to see how the cyber security landscape in India\n\nhas evolved over the last few years as well.\n\nIt's very interesting to see that it's quite different\n\nfrom countries like Australia or the US, but also very similar.\n\nAnd over the last three years, initially, when I'd speak to CISOs in CIOs in India\n\nand I've been reworked with many vendors,\n\na lot of the times responses that I get would be noise.\n\nAnd in the last six months, specifically, as we've spoken to more CISOs in the country,\n\nI think a lot of you have said yes to that answer.\n\nAnd even if the number is a bit smaller, 20 to 50 vendors,\n\nor probably in a couple of hundreds, the vendor landscape in India is evolving.\n\nAnd the third-party space in India is evolving as well.\n\nA few of the reasons why that's happening, I think,\n\nis because a lot of companies are moving towards the cloud,\n\nfrom having on-prem solutions to basically having fast applications\n\nfor a lot of the world as well.\n\nSo keeping that in mind, we've designed the agenda for today's webinar,\n\nwhere I'm going to be speaking about a few things,\n\nwhich is, firstly, what is vendor risk and what is vendor risk management?\n\nSecond thing, from a local perspective,\n\nwhat is the importance of vendor risk management for Indian businesses?\n\nAs an organization, how can you develop an effective\n\nvendor risk management strategy?\n\nAnd this could depend whether you're just starting out on that journey,\n\nor you have a bit more of a mature process in place as well,\n\nbut basically how can you have an effective one?\n\nAnd no matter what the size of the organization,\n\nthere are some common challenges that organizations face\n\nwhen it comes to vendor risk management and implementing\n\na vendor risk management strategy as well.\n\nWe will think about some of those today as well.\n\nAnd lastly, after all of this, we'd also see how God\n\nhas been helping organizations manage vendor risk.\n\nAnd if we're not already helping you how we can have to be\n\nhelp you manage vendor risk for your organization as well.\n\nSo that's a bit of the agenda for today on a very, very high level basis.\n\nComing to what vendor risk is and what is vendor risk management.\n\nAs an organization, as you're transitioning towards the cloud,\n\nmoving from on-prem solutions towards using SaaS applications,\n\nas I was mentioning, the vendor landscape would be increasing a lot.\n\nSo any third party organization and the risk that's arising\n\nfrom an organization and your relationship to those vendors\n\nthat provide both products and services to you.\n\nSo it could be your HRMS, it could be a payroll provider as well.\n\nSo that's your third party vendor essentially and the risk arising\n\nof using the third party vendor because they could be hosting\n\ncustomer data, business data, employee data for you.\n\nThat's essentially vendor risk.\n\nAnd ultimately, these third parties could be utilizing third parties\n\nof their own, which end up becoming your fourth parties.\n\nSo what you see on the right hand side of the screen here\n\nis that each third party could be having multiple fourth parties.\n\nSo your supply chain landscape essentially then becomes a lot wider\n\nthan what you think.\n\nAnd a lot of times it becomes very, very important to see the risk\n\nthat's been posed, not just by the third parties that you're\n\ninteracting with directly, but also with the parties that they're\n\ninteracting with as well.\n\nAnd basically vendor risk management.\n\nIn simple terms, it's the management monitoring and evaluation\n\nof risks that are posed by these third party vendors,\n\nwhether it's directly or indirectly.\n\nWhen you get into the nitty-gritty of things,\n\nyou see basically how much risk they can pose.\n\nAnd ultimately, how it can cause damage to you as an organization\n\nas well and why it's important to have a robust\n\nvendor risk management strategy as well.\n\nOver time, as companies are evolving in the cyber security practices,\n\nthe cyber security needs are changing over time as well.\n\nYou see a few stats on the screen here.\n\nI'd probably like to focus on some of those,\n\nwhich probably would be of interest to you.\n\nThe first one that you're seeing on top is that, you know,\n\ndata breach detection and the cost that's associated with it.\n\nIf a data breach is detected within the first three to three and a half\n\nmonth, you know, it can cause an organization up to three million\n\ndollars, a lot of breaches aren't even detected in that timeframe.\n\nAnd the harsh reality is that a lot of times these breaches could end up\n\ncosting a lot more to an organization than just the three million dollars\n\nthat's mentioned here.\n\nBut what's more shocking is that almost 30% of data breaches that\n\nhappen are directly caused by third parties.\n\nOff late, you know, in the last one to two years,\n\nthere have been many breaches that have happened, that have happened\n\nactually because of third parties.\n\nSo for example, you know, earlier this year, we had Samsung and Qualcomm\n\nthat basically had, they were affected because of a data breach,\n\nbut it was no fault of theirs, a vendor of theirs and Vidya,\n\nessentially, let some information open that could be accessed,\n\ncosting them a data breach.\n\nIf you were to look at more local examples from Indian perspective as well,\n\nI think it was about a year, a year and a half ago where, you know,\n\na bit longer, it's like, you know, type of communication at home.\n\nAnd I think one of the big banks in the country as well got affected\n\nbecause of a data breach.\n\nBut again, it was not a data breach that happened directly\n\nbecause of their fault.\n\nOne of the third parties of threat providers,\n\nRoute Mobile, essentially, left some information openly accessible,\n\ncausing a data breach for these organizations, ultimately.\n\nSo, you know, there's so many breaches that happen because of third parties\n\nand not because of an organization's own negligence,\n\nwhich is where it becomes very, very important to keep that eye out in your third party\n\nand having a vendor risk management program in place.\n\nYou know, despite all of these breaches that happen because of your vendors,\n\nyou know, only four out of 10 organizations, which is roughly about 40% organizations\n\nthat have a mature vendor risk management program in place.\n\nI'm sure many of you who are here today are in the process\n\nof either building that vendor risk management framework.\n\nI already have one, but I'm looking to make it more mature as well.\n\nAnd that's where, you know, we'd be talking about how you can make this better,\n\nbut yeah, like there's only four out of 10 organizations that have confidence in saying\n\nthat they've got a fully mature vendor risk management program.\n\nActually, 30% of the organizations, you know, only have an ad hoc\n\nor no significant vendor risk management process.\n\nAnd what I mean by that is that a lot of organizations probably assess vendors\n\nwhen they're bringing them on board.\n\nSo, you send your due diligence forms when you're on boarding a vendor,\n\nfor example, you do that, that goes into a repository and that's it.\n\nFrom an ongoing perspective, you know, almost 30% of organizations here\n\ndon't have anything in place where they can continuously see what their vendors are doing,\n\nwhere they have, you know, even an annual assessment program on their vendors or not.\n\nAnd that is where the big gap is.\n\nAnd I think as a country like India is getting more into the space of, you know,\n\nhaving these practices in place, but it's very much a work in progress\n\nthat's happening at the moment.\n\nA lot of you, I think, have, you know, regulations to meet now as well,\n\nwhich is where, you know, third party risk management is coming front of mind\n\nfor a lot of organizations.\n\nAnd, you know, when I talk about, you know, organizations from a local Indian perspective as well\n\nand talking about, you know, how things have evolved over the last few years.\n\nIn fact, if we just compare 2022 to 2021, so just within the last one year,\n\nthere has been an increase of, you know, 6.6% when it comes to the cost of,\n\nan average cost of a data breach in India.\n\nAnd this cost is only set to go up because, you know, there is so many breaches\n\nthat are happening affecting, you know, a larger number of people every time a breach happens as well.\n\nSo, as of 2022, like the average cost of a data breach in India is almost 18 crore rupees.\n\nIt's not a small amount.\n\nAnd if this data breach were to happen because it's a third party that you're working with,\n\nyou know, this could lead to a bigger issue as well.\n\nIndia is home to many, many popular third party vendors.\n\nWe've got a couple listed here like Microsoft, American Express.\n\nWe've got bigger ones like Accenture, you know, who've got a massive global client face that they work with.\n\nAnd if there was a data breach that were to happen with any of these organizations,\n\nlike it could lead to a significant damage, not just to their organizations,\n\nbut everyone that's involved within that breach as well, which is where I think the government has a bit more\n\nof a front of mind focus when it comes to third party risk management in India as a flight as well.\n\nThere are multiple, multiple regulations that are being worked on at the moment or being passed\n\nfor organizations to have front of mind visibility when it comes to their third parties.\n\nSo, we've got, you know, there are cyber security directives that were issued by certain just earlier this year.\n\nI think RBI has new guidelines that they, you know, planning to implement early next year,\n\nwhere they would want, you know, RBI regulated entities to one,\n\nhave a pretty strong, you know, control when it comes to their own attack surface.\n\nBut not just that, they would also want organizations and organizations regulated by the RBI to have that third party vision as well\n\nand have that continuous assessment and monitoring being done for your third parties.\n\nI think if you're looking to get ISO certification, you know, third party assessments on a regular basis,\n\nit's something that's a requirement for your ISO certifications as well.\n\nI think SEBI also had a new regulation that came out just yesterday for entities regulated by SEBI as well\n\nto have more a third party viewpoint too.\n\nSo, there's not just one thing, you know, the data protection bill that's coming out as well.\n\nSo, multiple regulations from the government side that are coming up only to make sure that, you know,\n\nbusinesses are secure, not just from, you know, the forefront of their own organization,\n\nbut as the cyber security landscape increases towards the third party perspective,\n\nthey're also secure from a third party perspective as well.\n\nAs we were talking about breaches and, you know, regulations that are coming out,\n\nover the last 11 months, now sitting the way in November,\n\nIndia has been no stranger to data breaches.\n\nThere has been many, many data breaches that have happened,\n\nsome of the popular ones that you see listed on the screen here.\n\nYou know, when we look at PowerPay, for example, there was about 37,000 users that got affected, you know,\n\nthe cause of it, and the data that was leaked as a part of this data breach was used,\n\nthe name UBI IDs, and, you know, email IDs of insurance and banking firm employees,\n\nlike, you know, having UBI IDs leaked as well, like, it's pretty critical in nature.\n\nAnd this was just about a couple of months ago.\n\nAnother big breach that happened in India less than a month ago, in fact, was Tata Power,\n\nwhere there was a lot of confidential information that got leaked.\n\nAnd, you know, there was bank accounts, employee bank statements,\n\nremuneration details, and, you know, passport information that was leaked as well.\n\nAnd all of this information was available on the dark web, too.\n\nAnd one thing that's very important to keep in mind is,\n\nbefore information actually ends up on the dark web, for example,\n\nit has to be publicly accessible somewhere at some point in time.\n\nAnd by the time the information lands up on the dark web,\n\nit's too late for an organization to, you know, secure it.\n\nWhere organizations should be focusing, and, you know, keeping their eye out\n\nis basically the open and the deep web, so to say.\n\nWhere securing information at the root holds a lot more importance\n\nthan, you know, when it's already on the dark web.\n\nIt's obviously very important to know what's out there on the dark web\n\nto make sure that, you know, you're always ahead of it.\n\nBut a better way to tackle it is to basically make sure\n\nthat you're able to prevent that information from leaking in the first place.\n\nAnd the third breach that you're seeing over here is a classic example of it,\n\nwhere, you know, threat actors basically show, you know,\n\n130 code repositories, you know, that were owned by, you know,\n\nthey were owned by drop-offs on the GitHub.\n\nAnd as we were talking about third parties and regions that, you know,\n\nhave been caused by third parties.\n\nNow, for example, as an organization,\n\nyou have drop-offs as a vendor.\n\nAnd out of those 130 code repositories, you know, where data was leaked,\n\nif one of those code repositories had any kind of information,\n\nor any kind of login information for your organization,\n\nthat could result in a data breach for you.\n\nAnd again, that was because of a data leak by a third party drop-offs in this case.\n\nSo it's very, very important to make sure that, you know,\n\nyou know, you're keeping that eye out on the open and the deep web as well,\n\nand not just for your organization, but from a third party perspective,\n\nwhat are your vendors leaking?\n\nAnd how can you as an organization work with your vendors to make sure that,\n\nyou know, that they're not leaking that information out and ultimately causing you\n\nmillions of dollars across the groupies in a data breach, essentially.\n\nAnd that's where, you know, building an effective VRM strategy comes into play,\n\nyou know.\n\nA lot of you might be sending those onboarding questionnaires that I was talking about,\n\nbut having something that's a single pane of glass view for everybody involved\n\nwithin the process and having a standardized process to assess your vendors\n\non a new basis as well is extremely, extremely important in creating\n\nthat, you know, effective vendorist management strategy.\n\nAnd we've got these four basic steps here where you can start implementing\n\nthat process within your organization, you know, and then start with the first one\n\nand kind of delve deeper into what each of these steps actually means.\n\nSo when you're looking at, you know, creating documentation for your vendor\n\nrisk management process, it's extremely important for you to outline, you know,\n\npolicies, programs, you know, procedures and specific goals and also, you know,\n\nmaking sure all the stakeholders that are involved within the process are aware\n\nof their responsibilities, aware in the process to, you know,\n\ndo they play a part in it?\n\nAnd then ultimately, you know, what are the workloads that you're going to be\n\nmanaging to remediate and manage the vendor risk as well?\n\nSo before you even get into assessing the vendors or before you get into, you know,\n\nkind of having, you know, a full-fledged assessment process in place,\n\nit's very important to build out, you know, a process internally as to how your organization\n\nis going to be managing this whole process.\n\nSecond thing is basically, you know, establishing vendor selection standards.\n\nThis goes two ways, because a lot of you would already be working with vendors,\n\nand, you know, you'd also be looking to bring on new vendors on board as the\n\norganization grows.\n\nSo it goes both ways, and having vendor standards, like selection standards or,\n\nyou know, continuing to do business standards for vendors is very important for you.\n\nSo, you know, there should be a very, very effective process for vetting your third\n\nparties, you know, from an ongoing basis.\n\nSo if you take both examples separately, if you look at new vendors that you're working\n\nwith, you know, kind of seeing how secure the external attack surfaces, you know,\n\nwhether they're soft to dark to compliant or not, if they, you know,\n\nin the space and making sure that they've got all the necessary controls in place.\n\nSo having that vendor selection process, a base process and a baseline set, you know,\n\nbusiness owners that are actually bringing the vendor on board, and in case, you know,\n\nthere's a vendor that you're already working with, come time of the renewal,\n\nyou know, having the same process implemented for them at the time of the renewal is\n\nsomething that can help you vet your already existing vendors and not, you know,\n\nlose track of the already existing supply chain that you have.\n\nAnd what I mean by that is come time of the renewal, you know,\n\nmaking sure that every vendor that's up for renewal goes through the same vetting process\n\nas a new vendor would, and how this would help you is you'd be able to see, you know,\n\nwhat the external security controls look like, what the internal security controls look like,\n\nand whether, you know, you want to do business with this vendor on an ongoing basis or not.\n\nSo for a new vendor, you can choose to weather work with them or not, and if it's an already existing vendor,\n\nin that case, you decide whether you want to continue doing business with this vendor or not.\n\nManuel said that baseline of, you know, what you want to be doing with a vendor and, you know,\n\nwhat your risk appetite as an organization also is.\n\nYou know, you perform your due diligence.\n\nA lot of you do it at the beginning of your journey with a vendor.\n\nYou know, for some vendors, you might be sending those annual exempt sheets to them,\n\nthen they send that back to you via email, you know, a lot of times it gets lost.\n\nYou probably a lot of times don't know when, you know, the assessment date for a vendor is due as well,\n\nand, you know, until they renew will come.\n\nAnd if you're working with a vendor with a multi-year contract, and, you know,\n\nyou only rely on the renewal to assess them, you probably wouldn't miss that they're up for an annual assessment as well.\n\nWhich is why that due diligence process becomes very, very important.\n\nYou need to ensure that, you know, you're assessing your critical vendors annually, at least.\n\nIn some cases, people even like to assess them on a one-to-six-month basis.\n\nSo step one would be to tear your vendors.\n\nAnd what I mean by tearing is you identify which vendors of yours are critical,\n\nwhich vendors of yours are medium risk and which vendors of yours are low risk.\n\nA good way to assess that is what kind of data do they have of your organization\n\nand how much data do they have access to.\n\nSo vendors could have access to things like, you know, business data, customer data, employee data,\n\nand so seeing what kind of data they have access to,\n\nbased on that, you know, assigning the tier to this vendor,\n\nand then, essentially, running your due diligence process of kind of spending that questionnaire to them, right?\n\nA lot of organizations like to assess their vendors based on ISO 27001 as a little, you know, guideline.\n\nYou know, NIST is another popular one for a lot of payment providers.\n\nYou copy the IDSS that you look at.\n\nSo basically, using the right framework to assess the vendors as well.\n\nAnd the third and the very important component, you know, which gets missed in point-in-time assessments during due diligence,\n\nis having that ongoing visibility on your vendors as well.\n\nSo, you know, having a continuous ongoing, you know, monitoring of your third-party vendors from an outside in view.\n\nSo, you know, making sure that that external attack surface is secure as well.\n\nAnd then once you've got, you know, your tiers assigned to your vendors,\n\nand to give you an example, if you've got a vendor that poses critical risk to your organization,\n\nmeans they've got, you know, they've access to business data and employee data for you.\n\nAnd secondly, you know, from an external attack surface, it shows up that they've got a lot of risks.\n\nWhen you send them a questionnaire, your due diligence questionnaire,\n\nit also comes back with them not having enough security controls in place.\n\nYou know that the business impact that this vendor would have in case they were to face the data breach would be high to your organization.\n\nAnd in that case, you need to work on a remediation plan with this vendor.\n\nAnd you work on a plan with this vendor as to how they're going to remediate.\n\nSome critical findings should be remediated immediately.\n\nAnd then you work on a way forward from there what's going to be remediated medium term, long term.\n\nAnd that's where you can decide, you know, whether you want to do business with this vendor or not as well.\n\nAnd lastly, you know, to develop like a robust internal auditing process as well.\n\nA lot of times, you know, when you're sending questionnaires manually to your vendors,\n\nand say if I send a questionnaire to a vendor, and a colleague of mine sends a questionnaire to a vendor as well,\n\nthen we both get the results back. Both of us are going to be looking at it from a different angle.\n\nSomething that might be of high risk for me might not be high risk for my colleague.\n\nAnd which is where the first part of, you know, the vendor is management documentation comes into play.\n\nThat's where, you know, you have those baseline, you know, policies, you have the baseline risk appetite for your organization\n\nthrough which you then internally build an audit process for your organization.\n\nYou know, no matter where in your vendor is management journey you are, whether you're just starting to build it\n\nor you know, in a process of maturing it, there are common challenges that all organizations, you know, essentially face.\n\nWhile building this process or whether they've built it or not, small organizations, big enterprises, you know, everybody kind of is going through the same thing\n\nat the moment as vendor is becoming front of mind for a lot of organizations.\n\nAnd some of the common challenges that, you know, we've seen organizations face and, you know, we speak to multiple seesals\n\nday in, day out is essentially seeing that, you know, there's increasing complexity in the vendor networks that they're seeing.\n\nSo, you know, the more fast applications they use, you know, the threat landscape is increasing.\n\nSo you see that, you know, there could be fourth party services being embedded in the software that you're using by your third party\n\nand that makes it a very complex situation for you as well.\n\nLike, you need to have, when I open for your fourth party in that case as well.\n\nAnd, you know, with all of this, you know, we were talking about the new regulations that are coming in place.\n\nA lot of organizations don't know where to start, you know, in terms of meeting the regulatory, you know, compliance requirements as well.\n\nSo having that starting point because of the increasing regulatory pressure, a lot of organizations don't know where to start\n\nand building that effective PRN strategy that we just spoke about could be a starting point, right? Like, because you're making sure that you're doing the bare, basic first.\n\nYou're following the, you know, minimum hygiene standards first, and then you're going to step two towards maturing that vendor with management process.\n\nAnd for a lot of organizations, you know, that I've spoken to and I've seen that they would go to, you know, open source tools at home basis\n\nonce ever so often to see how the external attack surface for a vendor is doing.\n\nBut especially if a vendor is critical or even medium risk, it's imperative to know, you know, how the external attack surfaces.\n\nAnd more from, you know, even if you're not seeing it every day, day in, day out, having alerts for it, you know, if an important port goes open on an important domain, you know, that, you know, you need to speak to that vendor about, you know, closing it.\n\nSo, you know, a lot of organizations don't have that structured monitoring process at the moment where they've got a single pane of class visibility, you know, for themselves and their vendors and they know exactly what they're doing.\n\nAnd because of that, you know, the due diligence process is also a bit insufficient, you know, as we were talking about, you know, not assessing vendors on a new basis or an ongoing basis is a big challenge a lot of organizations face at the moment.\n\nAnd, and as regulations and, you know, new regulations get passed, this is going to become a lot bigger a challenge as what it is right now, because, you know, the organizations would be a step behind the foreknowing exactly where to start in the due diligence process as well or where contract stand which vendor has been assessed,\n\nwhich vendor has not been assessed, when were they last assessed, so to have a track record of all of that in a centralized place becomes extremely, extremely important.\n\nAnd for a lot of people, they've got new staff that comes in, that comes in with, you know, different processes that they worked on in previous organizations as well, which leads to a lack of policy awareness and training.\n\nAnd which is where, you know, in the previous slide, when we were talking about having that initial set of policy set out, that becomes very, very important to tackle this challenge, where lack of policy awareness in training is a big, big component of, you know, not being able to effectively roll out the vendor risk management strategy.\n\nSo these are some of the common challenges that, you know, organizations, no matter where in their vendor risk management journey they are, usually face, and, you know, to tackle these challenges and to basically help you build a more robust vendor risk management strategy as well.\n\nUPCOT can help you with some basic things, and I'm sure, you know, a lot of you already use UPCOT, a lot of you are planning to use UPCOT sometime soon as well. So just to reiterate, you know, what you already might know as well, that, you know, the first thing that we were talking about, having that continuous visibility on your vendor's attack surface,\n\nand making sure that from an ongoing perspective, nothing goes wrong from your vendor's side, it's extremely important for that attack surface management.\n\nSo what UPCOT essentially does is, you know, we, you know, assess the third party risk when it comes to the attack surface, we quantify this risk and, you know, kind of help you, you know, see which risks are critical, which ones are high risk medium risk low risk.\n\nSo we even rate them for you based on the severity.\n\nSo you know, you know, which risk you want your vendor to work on first.\n\nWhen it comes to, you know, the risk assessment and the due diligence process as well, you know, rather than having an ad hoc process over multiple tools or emails or Excel sheets, Google forms, et cetera, you can basically centralize it all on our card in the single pane of glass visibility\n\nas well.\n\nSo you can basically send question and through our card.\n\nWhen you send the questionnaire through our card and when it comes back to your team, your team does not need to spend hours and hours assessing the responses that your vendors are going to be giving.\n\nThey could focus on real security issues and our guard takes care of basically assessing it.\n\nAnd when it's assessing the questionnaire, it's based off of, you know, the single way in which we assess risk.\n\nSo if two different vendors have answered no to a particular question, the risk that's going to be triggered is going to be the same for them, because, you know, at the end of it, if you identify that as a risk, it should be and whoever is assessing the questionnaire should not differentiate\n\nbetween it.\n\nAnd then basically making it more scalable and repeatable for you as an organization as well.\n\nYou know, if you're working with 50 vendors today, if that number goes up to 150 tomorrow, using manual processes is basically going to delay a lot of stuff for you.\n\nYou probably wouldn't be able to do it effectively.\n\nAnd it's not a scalable process to be very honest.\n\nSo, you know, to making sure that, you know, it's all automated and scalable for you, you can basically have a single repository of all your vendors.\n\nYou can know when then it's supposed to be assessed next.\n\nYou can set up, you know, notifications for yourself that it's time to assess the vendor again.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo all of that can be centralized in the one place.\n\nAnd, and for a lot of, you know, GRC specialists, infosec managers, so everybody has reporting requirements to different groups of people.\n\nSo that can help you automate that reporting requirements as well. You don't have to build manual reports, you know, worddogs or excel sheets. You know, we've got both summary reports to us, you know, reports that can even go down and drill into each risk that's being identified.\n\nSo, you know, different people have different requirements for reporting.\n\nWe've got the library of reports that you can choose from and, you know, create those reports and something, you know, when it comes to working on a remediation plan with your vendor as well.\n\nYou can work on that right from our car too. So you can send remediation requests to your vendor, but it's all centralized in the one place for you.\n\nAnd then, you know, something critical is being identified. You can work on them by then they're going to be remediating it by as well.\n\nSo at the end of it, you know, it's automating the entire process for you, saving you tons of time, you know, instead of looking at answering a questionnaire and, you know, doing a Monday and active video looking at it, we identify the risk for you, automate the whole process.\n\nAnd lastly, like it's in the single pane of class visibility for you, there's one, you know, lens that's looking at it all, and you can export it all as a report and also work on the mediation.\n\nSo that's essentially how I've got can help you meet all these challenges.\n\nAnd, you know, I'm probably going to take a little bit of a break now, you know, throw the mic back to the floor and see, you know, if there's any questions that any of you might have had for me, you know, while I was discussing about the vendor risk management strategy.\n\nThank you for sharing all those insights on that. We do have questions from the audience.\n\nSo, Manikanden from Pila, Manikanden Pila from Chinchin Kochi has asked with security, which security certification should we look for while on boarding a window.\n\nAbsolutely. And great question, Manikanden there as well. I think it depends on the nature of the vendor that it is as well.\n\nSo say, for example, if you're working with a vendor, you know, that has access to any kind of data for you as well.\n\nI think SOP2 type 2 is a very, very good place to start and make sure that that vendor is at least SOP2 type to certified.\n\nLike, for example, even we have an organization get asked for that kind of certification too, you know, and then beyond that, I think you need to run that due diligence process on them if they have access to any kind of data for you.\n\nAnd that essentially depends on, as an organization, you know, what standard do you want to abide by.\n\nSo, ISO 27001 and NIST are two of the most popular ones that I think NIST is a bit more extensive and organizations in the recent past that I've spoken to are kind of moving more towards having their vendor being compliant towards NIST is well.\n\nSo, yeah, so as the bare minimum having the SOP2 type to report and then ultimately assessing them based on ISO and NIST, if it's a vendor that does not have access to much data for you.\n\nI think just a basic questionnaire is well would be fine, but it totally depends on what kind of relationship the sender has in your organization.\n\nNext, so Shaq from Mumbai has asked, as we understand our guard can be used to undertake continuous monitoring of windows.\n\nSo, is there a difference in the type of monitoring done for a safe or manpower supplying window vis-a-vis or cloud services providing window.\n\nNice question, Shaq as well.\n\nSo, when it comes to monitoring, we don't want to differentiate in terms of what we are looking for when it comes to any organization.\n\nLike because at the end of it, you know, if there's a port that's open and if a data breach happens because of that port being open, the effect would be the same for any kind of organization.\n\nHow you should essentially look at different kind of vendors and your relationship with that vendor as an organization should be that if you're looking at say a manpower supplying window vis-a-vis or cloud services providing window,\n\nyour manpower supplying window could be a low tier vendor for you.\n\nSo, a low risk and a cloud services providing window is high risk.\n\nNow, what you can do on up guard is basically set notifications accordingly.\n\nSo, for a cloud services providing vendor, your notification could be that I want to be alerted every time that score drops or every time a new risk is alerted.\n\nBut for a manpower supplying window, you could be like, I want to be alerted if the score drops below 50 points or 100 points.\n\nSo, customizing those notifications based on the tier that's been set for this vendor.\n\nSo, you can use up guard as a baseline as to, you know, identifying what your risk is when it comes to a particular vendor,\n\nand then how you want to be alerted can be basically customized based on your relationship with the vendor.\n\nThank you. The next question is from Kavir, she's from Bama Ludu and she asks, does SID question help work for vendors?\n\nSometimes organizations do want to assess their vendors on seek as well. So, yeah, in short, yeah, you know, you can assess, use the seek framework to assess.\n\nPlease feel free. We do have more time in hand.\n\nSo, if you have any questions, please feel free to drop in.\n\nLooks like those were the questions. I'll read for another two seconds.\n\nAll right, no more questions, but we do have an announcement. We have an upcoming summit and Kaya from Amgard has dropped in a link in the comment section.\n\nPlease, please register for this event.\n\nOkay, there's a question somewhere.\n\nCan we modify a questionnaire for different vendors?\n\nAbsolutely, Abigit. So, what you can do, you know, when you're looking at a guard, for example, we've got a library of close to 20 questionnaires.\n\nYou can one select a different questionnaire to be sent to a different kind of vendor that you want to be also have a custom question I build up.\n\nIf you do have a questionnaire that, you know, you use as an organization, you can actually build it on our country.\n\nYou can actually select, you know, the kind of risk you want each question, like the answer to each question to pose based on your organization's, you know, risk matrix that you might be working with.\n\nSo, you can totally build that on our guard as well.\n\nOtherwise, you know, before you build anything on our guard, I would recommend seeing the library because chances are very, very high.\n\nThey've already got it covered in one of the other questionnaires that we have on the platform already.\n\nSo, yeah, you can, and you should be sending different questionnaires to different vendors as well.\n\nSo, if it's a low risk vendor, they don't want to get a questionnaire because 200 questions, for example, like, you know, save that for someone that has more access to data for you.\n\nIf it's a low risk vendor, send them a short form questionnaire just to make sure that, you know, they are secure.\n\nAll right.\n\nI hope that answers your question, WG.\n\nAll right.\n\nThere's an announcement.\n\nPlease feel free to, like, register for the summit.\n\nWe look forward to you joining there as well.\n\nAnd thank you, Samya, for sharing those insights.\n\nI'm sure the audience has a lot to take away from this session.\n\nI think we can close the session for now.\n\nAwesome.\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining.\n\nAnd if you've got any questions, you know, for UpGuard or me, you know, feel free to email me.\n\nMy email is there.\n\nOtherwise, if you've got any generic questions as well, you can email ourselves.\n\nAnd, you know, we're hoping to, you know, speak to some of you in the future.\n\nThanks a lot for joining.\n\nThanks."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"},"hubspotForm":{"hubspotFormId":"f85d8939-71e8-41ad-b715-330425f01243","hubspotId":"228391","hubspotFormSeconds":"267","hubspotFormIsSkippable":"false","on":"true","hubspotFormEnabled":"true","hubspotFormHeaderText":"Want to learn more?"}},"vulcan":true,"branding":"false","showCustomerLogo":"false","customerLogoImageUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/1b2c11a64bb5009d0c284432cc3856f4.bin","customerLogoTargetUrl":"https://UpGuard.com","stillUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/dfbabe2c31e57fc9555463324186538d.jpg","unalteredStillImageAsset":{"url":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/dfbabe2c31e57fc9555463324186538d.jpg","width":"2907","height":"1687"}},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"},"hubspotForm":{"hubspotFormId":"f85d8939-71e8-41ad-b715-330425f01243","hubspotId":"228391","hubspotFormSeconds":"267","hubspotFormIsSkippable":"false","on":"true","hubspotFormEnabled":"true","hubspotFormHeaderText":"Want to learn more?"}},"vulcan":true,"branding":"false","showCustomerLogo":"false","customerLogoImageUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/1b2c11a64bb5009d0c284432cc3856f4.bin","customerLogoTargetUrl":"https://UpGuard.com","stillUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/dfbabe2c31e57fc9555463324186538d.jpg","unalteredStillImageAsset":{"url":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/dfbabe2c31e57fc9555463324186538d.jpg","width":"2907","height":"1687"}}},"options":{}};
