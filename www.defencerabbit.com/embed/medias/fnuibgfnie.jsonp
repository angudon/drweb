third, party data breaches through effective vendor risk management.\n\nMy name is Catherine Chipeta, and I'll be your moderator for this webinar.\n\nWe're joined by our speaker, Chris O'Brien, the Manager of Product Activation here at\n\nUpGuard.\n\nToday, Chris will share his expertise on why vendor risk management is critical for U.S.\n\norganizations, and provides strategies for reducing the risk posed by your vendors.\n\nAt the end of Chris's presentation, we'll have a Q\u0026A time, so if you do have any questions\n\nfor Chris, please feel free to drop these in the Q\u0026A chat at any time during his presentation.\n\nNow let's get started.\n\nOver to you, Chris.\n\nPerfect.\n\nThanks, Catherine, and thanks everyone who has tuned in today.\n\nI'm excited to spend some time talking through vendor risk management with you all, you know,\n\na little bit of background about me.\n\nI've been here at UpGuard for a little bit over two years, and I currently manage our\n\nproduct activation team.\n\nSo essentially, our role as product activation is to act as a technical resource for all\n\npre-sales activities.\n\nSo that being said, I've had the chance to work with hundreds of organizations ranging\n\nboth from, you know, small local startups who are maybe building a vendor risk management\n\nprogram for the very first time, up to your large enterprise organizations who have maybe\n\na very in-depth and formal process, and everything in between there.\n\nI help people understand best practices, workflows, where to save time, and how at the end of\n\nthe day to reduce their risk that's brought on with the vendors they are working with.\n\nIn terms of an agenda for today, we're going to be speaking about a few things.\n\nFirstly, what is vendor risk and what is vendor risk management?\n\nSo just covering off some definitions to make sure we are all on the same page about\n\nwhat we are covering.\n\nAgain, from a local perspective, what is the importance of vendor risk management for\n\nU.S. businesses specifically?\n\nWe'll then dive into some of the steps that organizations can be taking to develop an\n\neffective vendor risk management strategy.\n\nThose will cover items both for people who may or just starting out on this journey,\n\nor those of you who already have a mature process in place and are looking to make some\n\nsmall improvements or changes.\n\nRegardless of where you stand in company size and maturity, though, there are some common\n\nchallenges people are facing, so I'll cover some of those.\n\nAnd then, of course, at the end, I'll dive into a little bit about how UpGuard has been\n\nhelping organizations manage vendor risk and where we play a role into the larger picture.\n\nAnd then, like Catherine mentioned, at the end, we'll have time for Q\u0026A to discuss anything\n\nthat you want to further than what I've mentioned in the presentation.\n\nSo coming into what is vendor risk and what is vendor risk management.\n\nVendor risk really boils down to the risk that your organization takes on as part of\n\nany relationship you have with your third parties.\n\nNow, this could be anyone from your HR management solution or your payroll provider, your CRM,\n\nvideo conferencing solution, really anyone you work with.\n\nAnd then the risk that arises changes based on the type of data they are hosting or have\n\naccess to, so be that PII, customer data, business operation data, et cetera.\n\nAnd then it's always important to remember that just how you are using third parties\n\nto help run your own business, your vendors are doing the same.\n\nSo the third parties that your vendors are using become your fourth parties, so on and\n\nso forth.\n\nAnd as you can imagine and see on the visualizations here on the right, this can quickly\n\ncreate a large and complex vendor landscape.\n\nAnd depending on the relationships and the sensitivity of the data being handled, it may\n\nbe important not only to track the third parties you work with directly, but potentially\n\nalso the fourth parties as they may also have access to your data.\n\nNow, this has only been exaggerated over the past several years as organizations have transitioned\n\nmore and more heavily towards the clouds and using multiple task solutions, various integrations,\n\net cetera.\n\nSo for purposes of today's conversation, any third party organization and the risk that's\n\ncoming from your relationship to these third parties will be considered your vendor risk.\n\nThen when it comes down to vendor risk management in the most simple terms, this is going to\n\nbe managing, evaluating and monitoring of the risks that are posed by these various vendors.\n\nNow of course, there's much, much more to it than that, but the goal really is to understand\n\nwhat risks are your organization taking on by working with your vendors, track those\n\nrisks over time, mitigating them wherever possible.\n\nNow I know I touched on this just a second ago, but the broad adoption of the cloud has\n\nonly increased the vendor landscape that many organizations are using, which of course opens\n\nyou all up to much more risk.\n\nThat being said, I've got a few statistics up here on the screen to help show how the\n\ncybersecurity needs have been changing over time and really why a solid vendor risk management\n\nprogram is increasingly more important.\n\nAnd not with one that really helps to drive the importance of why we are talking today.\n\nThe change in where breaches are initiated.\n\nSo as you see here, 30% of all breaches are actually caused by third parties.\n\nSo while you may have done a really good job in setting up your own policies, putting\n\nprocedures in place, this may not be the same for your vendors.\n\nAnd as many companies are working with anywhere from maybe just a few vendors to several hundred\n\nvendors, it is really important to track how your vendors are managing their own security,\n\nmaking sure that they have the same controls in place that you do.\n\nNow looking at another statistic that probably isn't a surprise to many people is simply\n\njust the faster that breaches are detected, the more money that can be saved.\n\nSo looking back at 2022, it took about 270 days or nine months, roughly four organizations\n\nto identify and contain a breach.\n\nNow when you compare that timeframe to breaches that were able to be identified and contained\n\nin just about two months, or sorry, just about too much faster, this saved an average of\n\njust over $1 million.\n\nSo it's really important to make sure you have the right controls and policies in place\n\nwith your vendors so that you have an open line of communication.\n\nIf something were to happen, they have the procedures and policies in place to get to\n\nit quickly and make sure that your data can be handled or protected as well.\n\nNow regardless of the numbers I just mentioned, and the large amount of breaches being caused\n\ndirectly by third parties, only 40% of organizations have a mature vendor risk management program\n\nin place.\n\nNow I'd imagine many of you who are on the call today are in the middle of building\n\nyour own process or maturing in a ready built one.\n\nAnd that's where we will talk a little bit later on about how to improve on programs\n\nso that you can feel comfortable in saying that your vendor risk management is mature.\n\nIn that a step further, 30% of organizations have no significant vendor risk management\n\nprocess or only do ad hoc assessments or management of the companies they do business\n\nwith.\n\nWhat I mean by this, a lot of companies probably assess their vendors maybe just as part of\n\nonboarding, maybe you send or do diligence questionnaire or collect some security documentation\n\ninitially, but then not much if anything is done with that information, especially on\n\nan ongoing basis, there are no feature assessments, so it's really more of a check the box exercise\n\nrather than something that's going to be used to help monitor and manage your risk.\n\nNow of course, why is this important in the US?\n\nSo when I talk about organizations from a local perspective and talking about how we\n\nfit in the world of vendor risk management, it really quickly becomes apparent just how\n\nimportant this topic is.\n\nSo speaking strictly financially, the cost of the average data breach in the US is the\n\nhighest in the world, I just shied $10 million, coming up more than double the global average.\n\nIf you combine that with the ever increasing number of impacts, it becomes clear just how\n\ndevastating the impact of an incomplete vendor risk management program can be.\n\nYou know, the last year alone, 80% of all US organizations were notified of invulnerability\n\nor attacking the software supply chain.\n\nNow tying that to what I showed on the last screen with only 40% of organizations feeling\n\nlike their vendor risk management program is mature, there's clearly a lot of room for\n\nimprovement in this area.\n\nAnd that's been seen by the increasing set of regulations and requirements that government\n\nbodies have been imposing, including one, the legislation for a supply chain risk that\n\nwas introduced through the presidential executive order back in 2021, which included a variety\n\nof steps to improve on software supply chain security.\n\nAnd as you can all imagine, right, there's probably more similar to that that will be\n\ncoming in the near future.\n\nNow this being said, there is still a long way to go.\n\nWhat you've seen here now are three recent US breaches, all that happened within the\n\nlast couple of months.\n\nInteresting enough, and why this is important for today's conversation is that none of\n\nthese breaches were caused by these organizations directly.\n\nNow I'm not going to go through each of these in depth, but just at the high level, right?\n\nLooking at Nissan, close to 18,000 customers were impacted when a third-party software\n\ndeveloper that was using customer data for developing and testing solutions inadvertently\n\nexposed this information due to a poorly configured database.\n\nThis included full names, birthdays, finance accounts, a pretty sensitive information.\n\nLooking in at Uber, this never jumps up to close to 77,000 employees that were impacted.\n\nThis was their email addresses, their company ID numbers, Windows Active Directory information,\n\nas well as source code and internal corporate data for Uber.\n\nThis all reportedly came from a third-party vendor's AWS server, and info was subsequently\n\ngiven away for free on the dark web.\n\nFinally, looking at Gemini, this number jumps up even further to about 5.7 million users\n\nwho were impacted.\n\nA vendor of theirs had an incident that allowed the actor to collect email addresses and partial\n\nphone numbers.\n\nThey then turned around and used that as a phishing target for the customers to try\n\nto get more information.\n\nNow, taking this right to why we're talking today and how you can incorporate something\n\nlike this in your own organization.\n\nWhen it comes to creating an effective vendor risk management strategy, there really are\n\nfour major pillars or points to doing so.\n\nGoing around what you see on the screen here, first you have creating your vendor risk management\n\ndocumentation, then establishing your vendor selection standards, then you move forward\n\ninto performing your due diligence and finally develop a robust internal audit process.\n\nI'm going to dive deep into each of these, and so to talk into how you can do so and\n\nwhy they're important.\n\nStarting with creating vendor risk management documentation, this really entails outlining\n\nthe policies, programs, and goals of your program while making sure all stakeholders\n\ninvolved are aware of the responsibilities and where they play a part in this.\n\nFor you all, I'm sure this is no surprise, but this process of vendor risk management\n\ndoes not only include you and your security team, but it likely includes members of procurement,\n\nthe business relationship owners, legal, et cetera, so it's really important that everyone\n\nknows where this fits in and what part of the process they play, so this isn't something\n\nthat just gets forgotten about or pushed to the side.\n\nNow a big part of this documentation is defining a way to classify your vendors based on their\n\ncriticality to the business.\n\nThis can be as simple as defining maybe a three-tier structure that is based on the\n\ntype of information your vendors hold, so maybe all of your vendors that have access\n\ndirectly to PII or intellectual property would be your tier one vendors, tier two might\n\nbe those who have physical or remote access to company infrastructure, and tier three\n\nmight be vendors that have no PII information and who would cause little to no interruptions\n\nto daily operations if something were to happen.\n\nNow setting this up in the beginning is going to help ensure that the appropriate level\n\nof due diligence and the work is done and that the work required both from you and your\n\nvendors matches kind of the relationship you have.\n\nThat's establishing vendor selection standards, so really this boils down to having some sort\n\nof defined standards that you can look back on when making your decision about whether\n\nor not your organization is comfortable working with a vendor.\n\nNow these standards very well may change depending on your relationships with that vendor, which\n\nis where those tiers come up.\n\nYou can and frankly you should set different standards for each tier of vendors.\n\nSo for example, your tier one vendors will likely be held to a higher standard of security\n\npractices in your tier two or tier three vendors and will likely also be scrutinized more closely.\n\nBut by having this tier structure defined in the beginning and having these selection\n\nstandards defined as well, you can make really clear cut decisions when you are okay with\n\nor without working with a vendor.\n\nSo a big part of the vendor risk management process is the due diligence phase, right,\n\nwhich we'll get here in a second, but the information you receive from that really only\n\nbecomes useful if you have a baseline to compare to for decision making and can do so in an\n\nobjective way.\n\nYou know, I hear a lot of organizations tell me that they do questionnaires or they collect\n\nsecurity documentation, but at the end of the day, it ends up being more of a check the\n\nbox exercise because they frankly don't know what to do with it, right, or it may be too\n\ndifficult to take a step back and look at the vendor as a whole and make that objective\n\ndecision about what kind of risk they're posing to the organization.\n\nSo without those standards set up front, it becomes really difficult to make decisions\n\non a ongoing basis in a consistent manner.\n\nNow, if you are setting standards, you likely have to have some sort of defined risk level.\n\nHere at UpGuard, we give you the opportunity to score your vendor from zero to nine fifty,\n\nwhich you may be able to see in the image on the right, but by doing so, we make it really\n\neasy to set your standards based on some sort of consistent scoring basis.\n\nFor example, a lot of, you know, customers I work with maybe set a rule that all their\n\ntier one vendors maybe need to have a score of an eight fifty and above to be approved.\n\nNow, if that score drops below and then that may be six hundred to eight fifty range, they\n\ncould be approved conditionally based on maybe going through some mediation process, then\n\nanyone below six hundred maybe is not approved.\n\nBut you can see by having this standard inflation beginning, combining with an objective way\n\nto quantify risk, it becomes really clear cut on who you are and who you are not comfortable\n\ndoing business with making the process more efficient moving forward.\n\nNow, once you set your baseline, uh, vendor controls and determine your risk appetite,\n\nit's time to start performing your due diligence.\n\nNow, this is where you're going to start a review of the vendor to see how they compare\n\nto the standards that you set up previously.\n\nMost commonly, as you are all likely aware, this is typically done through security questionnaires,\n\nreviewing security documentation such as stock two reports or various audits like that.\n\nBut the goal here is to understand what controls do your vendors have in place, understand\n\nwhere there are gaps or room for improvement, and measure it over time to ensure that your\n\nrelationship with that vendor is okay and they're meeting those standards that you've\n\nset as an organization.\n\nNow, a lot of people I speak to and I would assume some on this call are already doing\n\nthis to some degree, especially at the beginning of your journey with the vendor, right?\n\nAnd then depending on your level of maturity, um, some of you, um, some of you may be doing\n\nthis on a recurring basis already.\n\nBut most of the time when I speak with people, this due diligence phase is a, is a pretty\n\nmanual process, right?\n\nYou're maybe sending out a questionnaire through an Excel form or word documentation,\n\nand then communicating back and forth with your vendor via emails or phone calls, which\n\ncan make the progress tracking or due date tracking through completion really tricky\n\nand also adds a lot of work on you to understand what due diligence do have I done?\n\nWhere are the gaps based on the responses and what can I do with this?\n\nAnd then when it comes to your follow-up assessments, tracking becomes extremely hard, right?\n\nWhen are the dates due?\n\nWhat vendors have we already received information from, et cetera?\n\nAlso a question I get from a lot of people I speak with is, I do some sort of assessment,\n\nI send a questionnaire, but when I get the responses back, I don't really know to do\n\nwith it.\n\nYou know, what steps do I take as an organization if a vendor doesn't use single sign-up for\n\ntheir employees or they don't have the disaster recovery policy?\n\nAnd that's where it ties back to the specific selection standards, as well as having some\n\nway to quantify risk, right?\n\nSo being able to track and measure that risk objectively over time is what helps you tie\n\nback to some sort of objective matter.\n\nAnd then these questions of what do I do with this becomes really easy because you've defined\n\nthat upfront.\n\nTime is also back to the tiering structure, the level of due diligence and the frequency\n\nof it will probably change based off of the tier of the vendor.\n\nYou know, your tier one vendors are probably going to get assessed.\n\nYou know, I always recommend on an annual basis at least.\n\nAnd your level of due diligence is probably going to be a lot deeper.\n\nMaybe you're sending a more detailed questionnaire.\n\nMaybe you're sending, you know, requesting software reports, pen tests, whatever maybe.\n\nAnd if you're tier two and tier three vendors, maybe you're doing a more light touch approach\n\nfor that due diligence.\n\nFinally, robust internal audit process, right?\n\nThis is a great way to ensure consistency across the reviews.\n\nSo meaning maybe if you have multiple members of your team assessing your vendors, it's\n\nalways good to go back and do some sort of audit to make sure that responses are being\n\ntreated in the same manner.\n\nIt's also a good way to make sure that a vendor who is maybe a tier two or tier three vendor\n\ntwo or three years ago still fits in that bucket.\n\nA lot of times you'll see people on board a vendor, a couple of years have gone by, they\n\nhaven't reassessed that vendor, but the relationship with that organization has changed.\n\nThe data they're being trusted with, what they're handling has adjusted over time.\n\nSo auditing it allows you to catch those items and then kind of revamp how you're treating\n\nthat organization.\n\nSo creating an effective vendor risk management strategy can sound like a lot.\n\nA lot of companies I work with come to us and they say they're doing this for the first\n\ntime.\n\nWe've created a templated policy that sends a lot of people out, talks through all of\n\nthis information step by step, helps them understand how to tier their vendors, what\n\nquestioners to send and how often, and then they can just tailor that to their specific\n\nbusiness needs.\n\nYou know, this is something that you don't necessarily need to be reinventing the wheel\n\non, but there are some customization to your own organization that is important to make\n\nsure and mesh as well with how you're working.\n\nNow, all of this being said, right, we just talked to you a lot about putting together\n\na vendor risk management policy, different parts to it, but if we take a step back at\n\nthe high level, vendor risk management seems relatively straightforward, right?\n\nIn the most simple terms, it's keeping track of who are your vendors, what data do they\n\nhave access to, and ensuring they have proper security controls in place.\n\nBut in reality, that can be very difficult to do for a few reasons.\n\nOne increasingly complex vendor networks, right, as you see here from a senior security\n\nengineer at a SaaS company, people need to consistently or constantly evaluate and reevaluate\n\nhundreds of vendors.\n\nAs I mentioned with the change to the cloud, with a larger vendor landscape, there's a\n\nlarge or a much, much bigger operational overhead that comes with vendor risk than there may\n\nbe used to be.\n\nThere's more integration, there's hundreds of vendors with varying levels of data, and\n\nkeeping track of this and keeping track of who has access to what is increasingly more\n\ndifficult.\n\nThe other common challenge I hear a lot is unstructured third-party monitoring process,\n\nright?\n\nA lot of companies already have maybe 100, 200, 300 vendors, but they're managed in a\n\nway that's not clear or not structured.\n\nIt's through Excel spreadsheets, different GRC tools, different people have information\n\nin different places, so keeping track of all this becomes extremely difficult.\n\nMaybe you use, try to do some sort of large Excel spreadsheet, maybe manage your assessment\n\ngauge through some sort of calendar, but try to do this all, especially combining the\n\nmanual tedious process, because where a lot of things start to slip to the gaps and assessments\n\nget missed.\n\nThen on top of all of this, there's that increased regulatory pressure, right?\n\nI mentioned earlier with the presidential executive order, that's one item, but two,\n\nI'm hearing customers day in and day out talk about, you know, this vendor wants us to be\n\nSOC compliant, this vendor wants us to look at ISO, this one NIST, so on and so forth.\n\nWithout some sort of structured vendor risk management policy in place, it becomes really\n\ndifficult to tailor your responses and tailor how you communicate your vendor risk to match\n\nthese needs.\n\nIf you have a really clear cut, organized procedure and program in place in the first\n\nplace, you can pretty easily tailor this to match the different regulatory items that\n\nyou're being asked about.\n\nFinally, lack of executive reporting capabilities.\n\nThis is one I hear a lot of people who maybe have already some sort of vendor risk management\n\npolicy in place, they're doing their assessments, they're doing their due diligence, but when\n\nit comes to, you know, speaking to their boss or the board or the C-suite, they have a really\n\ndifficult time explaining what they've done, because maybe they don't have it, you know,\n\nthat's where the quantification of risk becomes really useful.\n\nYou can really easily tell someone, hey, as an overarching organization, our third-party\n\nrisk is sits at a 850 out of 950, right?\n\nYou can give it a really clear numerical score with some graphs and some trends over time.\n\nTo help with maybe non-technical folks understand where the risk stands as a company.\n\nAnd then when something that is organized as well and quantifying the risk, you can get\n\neach other they want, you can say all of our tier one vendors, here's the top-rated, lowest-rated\n\nand in-between, you can get custom with the reporting if you get organized upfront when\n\ndoing this policy.\n\nNow, of course, all this ties back into how can approach help you manage vendor risk?\n\nAnd there's a few key components here that I'll speak to.\n\nThe first one is continuous attack surface management.\n\nSo we mentioned, right, or before I even get into that, I'll just talk about holistic\n\nbehavior using up guard to manage your third-parties and your vendors.\n\nBut having something in place like up guard, you're able to log all your vendors in one\n\nplace to keep track of who you're working with, and you can apply labels and tiers to\n\nkeep track of who are my tier one vendors, who are my tier two vendors, how has that\n\nchanged over time, and just have everything centralized that gives you the visibility\n\nyou might need to say, okay, we know we have 15 tier one vendors, we have 20 tier two,\n\nso on and so forth.\n\nSo just having that central repository is a really good first step.\n\nWithin that then comes the benefits of actually doing the program.\n\nSo the first is continuous attack surface monitoring.\n\nAll of those vendors you pull into up guard that you're working with will automatically\n\nget their external attack surface scanned once every 24 hours.\n\nSo we'll go through and we'll scan all their domains and IPs, look for where there are\n\nrisks and vulnerabilities, and we'll tie that to that numerical score I mentioned\n\nearlier.\n\nSo regardless if you have the time or the bandwidth to do your due diligence questionnaires,\n\neven if you can't do any of that, you'll get a risk score for that organization based\n\non that external attack surface, and that'll get updated once every 24 hours.\n\nSo you know, today three months from now, six months from now, nine months from now,\n\nyou can feel confident that in the background, you'll be kept up to date if any new key vulnerabilities\n\nwere to be found on that vendor.\n\nNow when it comes to really building out a mature process and taking the next step,\n\nwe give you the workflows for the due diligence and assessment process, right?\n\nWithin up guard, we have a prebuilt library of dozens of security questionnaires at your\n\ndisposal.\n\nWe'd have ones for ISO, NIST, CCPA, PCI, HECBAT for higher education, all these great questionnaires\n\nthat you can use, and what's really nice about them is the automation that's built in.\n\nAll of our questionnaires have conditional logic so that the vendors will only respond\n\nto questions that are relevant to their relationship to you, and then we also map the responses\n\nto risks.\n\nSo for example, if you ask someone about their security program and they come back saying,\n\nwe don't have a mature policy in place, that'll flag as a risk, and at the end of your assessment\n\nwith that vendor, you'll get a nice consolidated list of all the risks that are identified\n\nbased on the questionnaire that you sent them.\n\nThis will get then tied to a numerical score, which can very easily be tied and mapped back\n\nto the standards you set at the beginning.\n\nSo if you send someone a questionnaire, they respond and automatically come back, let's\n\nsay, at a 650, you can compare that to the standards you set for your Tier 1, Tier 2\n\nvendors, and make a decision on whether or not you want to work with them.\n\nWe then also give you the workflows for things like storing documentation, right?\n\nIf someone sends you a software report, you can store that in UpGuard, track the expiration\n\nof it, create custom comments, things like that, and then you can create a final risk\n\nassessment that ties all of this into one report.\n\nSo you can very quickly and easily create a report that includes the questionnaire you\n\nsent them, the automated scanning we've done, any additional documents you've collected.\n\nYou can leave custom notes at the bottom, maybe it's your recommendation to the business owner\n\nor things like that, and then you can track your, you know, do that final report and track\n\nit for future purposes.\n\nSo you can say, hey, we've done this assessment on vendor A, here's the information we collected,\n\nhere's the date we did it, here's the date of our next assessment.\n\nFinally reporting and remediation, right?\n\nA lot of times you get responses from vendors and maybe they're not satisfactory towards\n\nwhat you need from them.\n\nWe give you the workflows to communicate with that vendor transparently on, here's what\n\nwe found, here's where we're concerned, let's work together to get something remediated\n\nso that we can make this relationship work.\n\nAll of this is handled in the same platform, so again, it's centralized, it's streamlined,\n\nyou're not managing emails, phone calls, stock messages, it's all in one spot.\n\nAnd then reporting, everything in the platform can be reported.\n\nSo if you want to share the really detailed risks you are finding, if you want to be a\n\nmore high-level, non-technical report for the C-suite of all of your vendors and how\n\nthey've changed over time, everything's just centralized, customizable, and easy to do,\n\nmoving forward, as well as auditing, you can look back and see when things are done.\n\nAnd then one other item I will call out, we do also have a managed service link, so if\n\nmaybe you're looking at building out this program and you want some help assessing some\n\nof your vendors or you're not quite sure where to start, we do have a team of analysts\n\nthat can help do some of this on your behalf, they can send those questionnaires, put together\n\nreports, and kind of help walk you through the process so that eventually you can start\n\ndoing it on your own and get something that you can feel really confident with.\n\nNow that's really it for me today, I want to talk through a couple of those key items,\n\nmy recommendations for a vendor risk management program.\n\nNow I'll pass it back over to Katherine and we can jump into Q\u0026A and talk through some\n\nthings together.\n\nGreat, thank you Chris for such an insightful presentation, so yeah, we'll now get started\n\non the Q\u0026A, please do continue to drop your questions in the chat if you haven't already.\n\nCan see that we've had a couple come through from the Zoom, so the first one is, can we\n\ndo sandbox testing before onboarding SAS vendors who may have access to or for sensitive data?\n\nCan you repeat that one more time?\n\nSure, so can we do sandbox testing before onboarding SAS vendors who may have access\n\nto or store sensitive data?\n\nI would say it probably depends on the SAS vendor, I know for an upgrade for example,\n\nwe give everyone the opportunity to do a testing of our solution and they can do that with\n\ndummy data so they don't actually have to upload their real vendors, they don't have\n\nto put in real information about who has PII or answer security questionnaires.\n\nA lot of SAS centers I've heard of do something similar, but I think it's going to depend\n\non what kind of service they're providing, what the relationship is to them, but a good\n\nbest practice would be if they have a sandbox, do that first, understand where your data\n\nis being stored, and then go through your due diligence questionnaire or security questionnaires\n\nbefore committing to purchasing that solution.\n\nGreat, thanks Chris.\n\nAnd secondly, off the back of that question was do we need to learn application security\n\nas well to perform the above exercise?\n\nI would say you don't necessarily need to, and that's where having a solution like upgrade\n\nin place can become useful, whereas we already have these questionnaires built out for you\n\nand map what is a risk in place.\n\nSo even if you're not super familiar with the different risks and the different types\n\nof security, like you mentioned application security, by having something that already\n\nhas a pre-vote questionnaire and maps it to risk, you can kind of take that off your plate\n\nso you can feel confident knowing you're asking the appropriate level of questions and you\n\nknow when to flag something as a critical risk versus low level risk and everything in between.\n\nAnd then on that, the back of that, the conditional logic built into the questionnaires, at least\n\nin an upgrade, is going to help you make sure you're asking the appropriate questionnaires,\n\nthe appropriate question.\n\nSo you're not going to be inundating someone with infrastructure questions that has nothing\n\nto do with their infrastructure because what depending on their previous answers still get\n\nrouted a different way in the questionnaire.\n\nThank you, Chris.\n\nAnd lastly from Ms. Zoom is what kind of due diligence should we perform on tier one,\n\ntier two and tier three vendors?\n\nYeah, I think that's where things can get a little bit tricky of not only the type of\n\ndue diligence you do, but also the frequency of the due diligence, right?\n\nSo tier one vendors, I would say we're going to want to do the continuous monitoring, a\n\npretty detailed level questionnaire that goes into really specifics about how they're handling\n\ndata, how it's encrypted, how often they're reviewing policies, and you'll want to review\n\nany software reports, things of that that they may have.\n\nYour tier two vendors are going to be similar.\n\nMaybe on your first assessment of that tier two vendor, you do the same thing.\n\nYou do the really detailed in-depth questionnaire, get all those initial information.\n\nAnd then on an ongoing basis, that's where things can start to branch a little bit.\n\nYour tier one vendors, maybe you do every six months or every year, you send them that\n\nsame really detailed questionnaire, you review the same document, and you go to that same\n\nlevel.\n\nIf you're tier two, tier three over time, you can get a little bit more light touch.\n\nSo let's say you're tier two vendors, you do that really in-depth questionnaire and\n\nyou're one, maybe you're two or you're three, you bring it back a little bit and you get\n\nsome more high level information just to understand, has anything changed since we last spoke?\n\nDo you still have access to the same data?\n\nAre you doing the same audits?\n\nBut you might not need to go 100 questions deep with that vendor.\n\nAnd then your tier three specifically, maybe on the very beginning, you don't even do that\n\nreally in-depth questionnaire.\n\nYou start with some high level of 20 questions just about, do you have policies in place?\n\nDo you go through any sort of audit, et cetera?\n\nAnd then the frequency of that can be much less, that can be, maybe you do annually, but\n\nmaybe you do every two or three years, or just that contract renewal.\n\nSo tier one and tier two specifically, I would say it can kind of blur the lines a little\n\nbit of what you're doing.\n\nInitially on onboarding, I see a lot of people doing the same level of assessment.\n\nAnd then over time, it becomes kind of a little more broad for tier two and tier one stay\n\nwith that rigorous line of assessments.\n\nThanks, Chris.\n\nAnd thank you, Ms. Zoom, for your questions.\n\nWe do have one more at the moment.\n\nThis is an anonymous question.\n\nI think it ties in nicely with the question you just answered, Chris.\n\nIt's how often should I monitor high risk versus low risk vendors?\n\nYeah, there's a couple of things to that.\n\nOne is, you know, if you have a solution in place like UpGuard, the next part of that\n\nis regardless of if someone's high risk, low risk, medium, whatever it may be, you can\n\nhave them monitored 24-7, so you can pull them in to our platform, keep up to date once\n\nevery 24 hours with what's changing.\n\nSo if they were to have a breach that hits the news, if they were to have a new boulder\n\ngo to, it opens up over time, right, you can set notifications to be made aware of that\n\nright in the background.\n\nAnd then when it comes to the assessment, that's where you feel like you're procedures\n\nin the front place.\n\nMaybe you have everyone monitored, you know, day in and day out, but doing your due diligence\n\nassessments, he sets those different standards of tier one is every six months or a year,\n\ntier three is that contract renewal.\n\nBut regardless, I always recommend having that continuous scanning in the background,\n\njust because it's a good piece of mind and you can set up notifications so you don't\n\nneed to be monitoring it day in and day out, you can just be made aware when something\n\nimportant comes up.\n\nGreat.\n\nThank you for your question, and thanks for that great answer, Chris.\n\nJust see if we've got any more questions for now.\n\nWell, it looks like we've had a couple more come through.\n\nSo we have a question here from Antonella, Antonella asks, can vendors submit their\n\nprofiles to Upguard?\n\nAnd if so, can they attach assessments such as SIGLite?\n\nYes, definitely, there's a couple of ways we can go about this.\n\nOne, anytime you go to assess your vendor or a vendor gets assessed through Upguard, they\n\nhave the opportunity to publish that information within Upguard at no cost to them.\n\nSo maybe you assess one of your vendors for the first time.\n\nThey go through, they respond with their questionnaire answers.\n\nThey have the ability to turn on what we call a shared profile.\n\nThey can, of course, keep that access controlled.\n\nThey can put it behind the NDA or whatever it may be.\n\nBut then if another one of our customers were to look up that same vendor, it would show\n\nthat they have shared assets available.\n\nAnd rather than starting the assessment process from scratch, they can simply request access\n\nto those shared assets, saving both the customer and the vendor time on, you know, doing assessments\n\nthat maybe have been done in the past.\n\nPart of that shared profile allows them to upload security documentation.\n\nSo it could be something like a Stock Tier report or a Penta, or in the example of this,\n\nthey could upload a previously completed SIGLite that they've done, and then if people request\n\naccess to the shared profile, they can just simply grant them that information and work\n\nthrough the process that way.\n\nPerfect.\n\nThank you, Antonella, for your question.\n\nWe do have another anonymous question, which is, how can I check if a vendor complies with\n\nour regulatory requirement?\n\nYeah, there's a couple of ways with that, specifically with the questionnaires and due\n\ndiligence.\n\nSo if you're looking in, I just keep going back to the UpGuard questionnaire library,\n\nwe have questionnaires that are mapped to those different requirements.\n\nSo we have a questionnaire specific to ISO, specific to NIST, CCPA, HECVAD, so on and\n\nso forth.\n\nAnd then when the responses are given back, they'll map to the specific frameworks of\n\nthat regulatory requirement.\n\nSo if you send someone an ISO questionnaire, when you receive a response, those risks\n\nwill be specific to ISO itself.\n\nAnd then for ISO NIST specifically, you can actually combine the automated scanning information\n\nwith the questionnaire response to get a full framework compliance report on those two\n\nitems to see how they stand up.\n\nThanks, Chris, and we hope that that's answered your question.\n\nJust see if we have any more before we wrap things up.\n\nWe are just about at time.\n\nSo I think we have one more from Antonella.\n\nAntonella asks, how do you assure the accuracy of your third and fourth-party attack surface\n\nvulnerability detection?\n\nHow do you assure the accuracy?\n\nYes, there's a couple items to that, right?\n\nOne is the fourth party, the attack surface detection is pretty straightforward.\n\nWe're pulling that information from things we can find on your domain.\n\nSo we can find, you know, if you're using Java, if you're where your things are hosted, what\n\ndifferent items like that you have.\n\nFrom that, we can come up with the list of your fourth parties.\n\nNow it's not going to be fully, it's not to be every fourth party a company works with,\n\nbut it will be their tech stack fourth parties that we can confirm publicly.\n\nFor the attack surface vulnerability detection, though, we're just saying that once every\n\n24 hours, and that's pretty clear-class black and white information of is this port open\n\nor not?\n\nIs this CVE software version being run based on what we can find?\n\nThere isn't much room for kind of subjecting this on the vulnerability detection that\n\nwe're doing.\n\nNow we do give people the workflows, though, to kind of bring into it some of the real\n\nlife examples, right?\n\nFrom the outside in, it's really easy to say, hey, you don't have a D-mark policy or this\n\nport is open, but fact of the matter is some of that information needs to be set up that\n\nway because of the way a company is being handled, which is where we give people the\n\nopportunity to put in what we call a risk waiver.\n\nSo a risk waiver allows you to accept risks or allow your vendors to accept risks because\n\nof other commenting until they have in place.\n\nSo maybe there is an FTP port open, but they need that for file transfer and have other\n\nways to monitor it.\n\nThey can put in, or you can put in a risk waiver on their behalf, remove that risk or\n\nvulnerability from their profile to get a more built out view of what risks or vulnerabilities\n\nare relevant to your relationship with that company.\n\nThanks, Chris, and thank you, Antonella, for your fantastic questions.\n\nWe have time for just one more question, so this one comes from Zubi who asks, how do\n\nyou manage the remediation with vendors if they don't meet the initial criteria?\n\nYeah, there's a couple factors there, if it's from the questionnaire workflow, so if\n\nmaybe you send a questionnaire and they come back and say they don't have single sign-on\n\nor they haven't done role-based access controls, things of that nature, the way the questionnaire\n\nthey're set up in the platform is it's set up in a way that's really tailored towards\n\ncollaboration.\n\nSo you can communicate back and forth with your vendors as you're completing the questionnaire,\n\nbut then maybe you get all of your responses, they complete it, and like you're saying,\n\nthey don't meet the requirements you've set up in the beginning, that's where you might\n\nwant to open up a remediation ticket.\n\nSo separate from the questionnaires in UpGuard, at least, we have the ability to create a remediation\n\nticket where you would reach out to that vendor directly and say, hey, here's what we found,\n\nhere's where there's gaps and why doesn't meet our standards.\n\nNow let's work together to get these completed on a specific date.\n\nSo maybe you give them a month or two months to work together to have something fixed.\n\nOne, they can be see really transparently on what risks you're asking them about and\n\nwhere they came from, but two, they can actually see how fixing those risks will impact your\n\nscore.\n\nSo you can be as transparent with them and say, hey, you're a tier one crypto vendor,\n\nwe have requirements in place for the company that your score needs to be at least $7.50,\n\nhere's a list of risks that you can fix to help get there, and then manage that with\n\nthem over time so that they know what their goal is and what they need to do to reach\n\nthat goal in a really transparent, objective manner.\n\nThank you, Chris.\n\nAnd thanks, Zuby.\n\nThat was a great question for us to finish things up with our Q\u0026A as we are just about\n\nat time.\n\nSo we'll get to what's next.\n\nIf you do have any more questions for Chris, or if you'd like to learn more about how UpGuard\n\ncan help you manage vendor risk, you can feel free to email Chris directly or get in touch\n\nwith us at sales at upguard.com.\n\nAnd lastly, if you haven't already registered, come join us at UpGuard Summit on February
