right.\n\nWell, thank you, everyone, for coming today to our kick off UpGuard Session.\n\nWe're definitely excited to get this series of events rolling for everybody,\n\nwhere we touch on a variety of subjects that are going to be very pertinent,\n\nhelpful or otherwise, just really fun\n\nfor some of us practitioners of\n\nnot just cybersecurity, not just governance, risk and compliance,\n\nbut even more specifically taking a lean at the supply chain\n\nhouse of of of that landscape.\n\nAnd so today's inaugural Session\n\nis all about automating third party risk management,\n\nwhy it's valuable, why it's important, how some of us have already seen\n\nthe impacts of not automating this and moving forward.\n\nIf we're not already doing this, then how can we get started?\n\nSo very excited and eager to get this\n\nrolling for us on this very quick 30 minute session.\n\nSo a little bit about myself.\n\nMy name is Alex Nunez.\n\nI am UpGuard's Competitive Intelligence Analyst,\n\nwhatever that means.\n\nA little more specifically, I've been working in this space\n\nfor about seven years now, and across these years\n\nI have had the opportunity to work with hundreds of Chief Information\n\nSecurity Officers and other information security and risk leaders,\n\nspecifically helping provide a consultative approach and partnership\n\napproach towards solving this problem of third party risk\n\nand obviously those information security implications that come out of that.\n\nAnd so I'm very passionate about this space and subject,\n\nand I'm hoping that anything I can\n\nshare might be helpful in any of your endeavors as well.\n\nAs far as UpGuard,\n\nthe company that I have the distinct pleasure\n\nof working for on a day in day out basis, really at its core,\n\nUpGuard's mission is to help enterprises build resilient supply chains,\n\nand that is going to extend not just to that\n\ntippy top of the enterprise commercial sector,\n\nbut even that small business, small medium enterprise segment.\n\nWe have a lot of experience and success,\n\nnot just working with these companies, but also really partnering with them\n\non a day in, day out, year in, year out basis,\n\nhelping them mature and evolve their risk management practices.\n\nAnd so you can see some of the organizations that we've\n\nbeen able to work with here among many.\n\nAnd so we really are, I would say for sure, a leader\n\nin this whole premise of third party risk and supply\n\nchain management.\n\nSo again, I'm sure everyone is already\n\nthis whole,\n\nyou know, headlines about breaches probably seen on some of these cell sites.\n\nIt's a little nauseating at this point.\n\nTotally feel you on that.\n\nBut obviously, words, you know, it's it's worth repeating\n\nin the sense that every single incident is an opportunity for us to learn\n\nmore about what to do, what not to do,\n\nand understand how even these attackers are evolving\n\nwithin this whole problem of supply chain risk.\n\nAnd so, you know, very recently we have seen, again,\n\neven noncommercial organizations suffer from these impacts.\n\nIlluminate, which is a large provider of services\n\nfor a significant amount of our public school\n\ndistricts in the country recently,\n\nyou know, just this year actually had an incident\n\nwhere, you know, as a supplier to these school districts,\n\nthey compromised\n\nthe private information of, you know,\n\none of the most protected populations in our country, children.\n\nAnd with the amount of limited resources\n\nthat the school districts already have, the backward facing audit\n\nand the kind of risks that these, you know, protected children are now put in,\n\nand the resource intensivity of having to do that backward audit,\n\ndefinitely creating a significant amount of not just financial pain,\n\nbut even operational pain, right.\n\nAnd on the commercial side, just this year,\n\nin terms of,\n\nyou know, high concentration risk and having one organization\n\nthat is, you know, extremely common\n\nto many of us in this technology space,\n\nif one of their suppliers gets compromised and they're a supplier to us as well,\n\nthen that's almost compounding this whole problem of supply chain.\n\nSupply chain kind of inception, almost of the kind of risk\n\nthat we're susceptible to.\n\nAnd so as many of us already know, Okta, you know,\n\nI believe it was their vendor Sitel, were compromised by the hacker\n\ngroup Lapsus$ and that opened the door and talked of which then opened the door\n\nand to multiple of their customers.\n\nAnd so this problem is is starting to kind of\n\nget kind of like those Russian dolls one within another.\n\nHow do you understand which supplier was the supplier?\n\nWhich one wasn't? Blame gets tossed around.\n\nAnd so it can become not just a problem in terms of real security terms\n\nand business issue, but also even within the entire relational space,\n\njust creating a lot of headaches, a lack of trust in general.\n\nAnd that's not really the kind of commercial\n\nor technological environment that we want to be operating in.\n\nNow, as far as the business implications themselves,\n\nthis is already pretty established.\n\nBut, you know, it is very appreciated for sure that,\n\nyou know, organizations like IBM and the Ponemon Institute,\n\nI believe they run this survey yearly because I've I've been seeing it\n\nfor many years now, but I believe every year they're calculating\n\nwhat's the average cost of data breach in the United States.\n\nAnd I've been seeing this number tick up every year,\n\nand it looks like now it's being pegged at 4.3,\n\n$4.35 million.\n\nAnd so for many organizations, that cost is almost existential.\n\nAnd for other organizations of a much larger size, it's definitely\n\na lot more economical, if you will, to actually address the core\n\nissue than to have to\n\nencounter these costs unexpectedly.\n\nHowever, correspondingly,\n\non the other side of that, for organizations that aren't trying to,\n\nyou know, tackle this problem at the root through direct investment,\n\nsometimes, you know, I've heard of organizations just going to an insurer\n\nand trying to insure themselves against that risk.\n\nWell, unfortunately, large supply chain attacks that have been going on\n\nand even other incidents like the Colonial Pipeline breach, the Ukrainian war,\n\nhave started to increase this cost of cyber insurance premiums,\n\nas reported in the Wall Street Journal recently, I believe.\n\nAnd so this path itself is increasingly becoming a lot more expensive.\n\nAnd when you factor in the fact that regulators are responding\n\nwith an increasing amount of regulations and a CCPA and NYDFS 500,\n\nyou know, this whole acronym alphabet soup of new laws\n\nthat we're having to basically keep tabs on,\n\nput operational costs into our business\n\nthat's causing us to go and look for these efficiency gains,\n\nlook for people that we can work with, people we can trust, vendors we can trust.\n\nBut if they're getting hit as well, then that creates a whole other issue\n\nabout even how do we how do we trust these suppliers?\n\nYou know, when is that trust breached\n\nif they don't report their incidents for months on end\n\nor don't even know they had one?\n\nRight.\n\nAnd so this this whole ecosystem of suppliers, of us\n\nneeding suppliers but not being able to trust them\n\nis creating a pretty dicey situation in terms of our ability\n\nto actually conduct our business in an efficient manner.\n\nAnd so for us, being able to actually move beyond this space, right, move beyond\n\nthose implications or at least minimize the impact of them, it's imperative\n\nthat we find ways to gather efficiency in our practice of managing this risk.\n\nAnd so for us, you know, as as professionals in this space,\n\nwe know already that automation is going to be really\n\nthe only way that we can actually do this successfully for our business.\n\nAnd there's a few reasons why.\n\nObviously, the amount of security\n\ntalent out there, that supply of security professionals\n\nis absolutely currently not keeping up with the demand.\n\nAnd we ourselves ran a survey of our own customers\n\nand other potential customers,\n\nand we found that an average security team is only about ten people.\n\nBut the organization sizes that they're supporting are far, far larger.\n\nAnd so in terms of being able to,\n\nyou know, secure a an organization of many more people, that\n\nyou know, leverage factors is a bit off.\n\nHowever, we still have to be dependent on these SAS suppliers right.\n\nWe're not the only, you know, professionals\n\nor departments in our companies looking to gain efficiency.\n\nYou know, marketing needs to do things\n\nfaster sales, needs to do things faster engineering to do things faster.\n\nAnd we're essentially looking to other providers\n\nto be able to outsource this and become a lot more efficient.\n\nAnd that's going to mean that they're bringing on a lot more vendors,\n\na lot more suppliers into that supply chain,\n\nand we have to understand what's going on there.\n\nAnd that's going to create a much higher burden of proof.\n\nCustomers want to know what we're doing to secure that supply chain.\n\nInsurers want to know.\n\nRegulators want to know.\n\nAnd it's no longer okay to just say, hey, you know, we're looking into it.\n\nIt's an expectation now.\n\nAnd with this crowded landscape of vendors sending,\n\nyou know, ten sales emails a day saying, hey, we've got a solution that's going to,\n\nyou know, like stop me from getting breached.\n\nIt's really easy to overspend through oversight\n\nand overkill that limited budgetary resource that we have.\n\nAnd so, in order to\n\nbe able to really automate effectively, we have to know what we're looking for.\n\nAnd so what we've really developed is a three step process to help you understand\n\nwhat are the core functionalities that you ought to be looking for\n\nto automate third party risk management that's going to keep your budget in line,\n\nthat's going to be able to give you your people the amount of,\n\nyou know, extra power they need to be able to do their job\n\neffectively and ultimately secure the business.\n\nAnd so first step in that is\n\nyou've got to target that low hanging fruit.\n\nSo in terms of automation,\n\nevery supplier has a certain amount\n\nof public facing, internet facing, sometimes people call it\n\nlike a digital footprint, attack surfaces, what have you.\n\nAt every organization worth their salt\n\nhas a public facing facing presence on the Internet.\n\nAnd not only can you see it with the right toolset,\n\nbut definitely attackers are able not just to see this,\n\nbut they're actively searching\n\nfor these risks and entry points and vulnerabilities.\n\nAnd so your ability to be able\n\nto scan all of your suppliers and understand, you know, do they have RDP\n\nports randomly and not necessarily open SSL certification in place?\n\nYou know, what redirects do they have?\n\nAre they keeping up with their DNS registrations and such?\n\nAll of this information is going to give you insight\n\ninto kind of that general hygiene attention that they're paying,\n\nif not also give you some indication\n\nof very important risks that you ought to be looking out for.\n\nAnd actually, part of that is going to be informed\n\nby how well you're mapping out and defining your risk tolerance,\n\nnot just for any one single type of risk, but for risk risk categories as a whole.\n\nSo being able to understand for yourselves, you know, reflect\n\nand understand what are the risks that we can and can't tolerate.\n\nThat's going to help you then\n\nset some form of rules\n\ntrigger policy to be able to get alerted\n\non the dot when your supplier does have some sort of change\n\nthat creates one of these intolerable risks.\n\nYou'll be able to actually know on the spot and engage your suppliers\n\nand reduce or remediate that risk in a real term\n\nand within a timely manner.\n\nNow, step two, probably the most painful one, to be honest.\n\nSo everyone in on this call is probably pretty familiar\n\nwith the painful experience of security questionnaires.\n\nThey are on Excel, sometimes even worse\n\non word documents and it's just been a terrible way\n\nof understanding security among ourselves right.\n\nThe reason why we're doing this is a very good one.\n\nWe really want to have some form of security attestation\n\nfrom our suppliers, right.\n\nWe want to be able to know, hey,\n\nyou guys said that you had\n\nthis level of security, you have this control in place.\n\nHere's the documentation that you sent us, and it turns out that wasn't the case.\n\nWell, we might have to seek relief and other manners, right.\n\nBut if there's no documentation to actually highlight that attestation,\n\nthen the business might have a much harder time, if not impossible time\n\ngetting that relief.\n\nSo being able to automate that piece of the puzzle is definitely\n\ngoing to be one of the most time saving steps you can take.\n\nAnd then also being able to find a way to collate\n\nand integrate that external kind of third party or fourth party,\n\nif you will, are getting kind of, again, supplier Inception.\n\nBut, you know, we have organizations that are looking at, not just us,\n\nbut our vendors in terms of like SOC II Audits,\n\nPentest reports, bug bounties.\n\nYou know, these are key pieces of evidence that we want to know\n\nand we need to be able to pull risks right\n\nout of those external pieces of evidence and ultimately\n\nhave one way where we can centralize\n\nall of the risks that we've identified from that external view,\n\nfrom the questionnaire of you, from this certification perspective,\n\nand within a few clicks be able to actually produce and generate\n\nthe ultimate work product, which is a report that says,\n\nHey, here is our risk assessment for this vendor.\n\nHere's the steps we took to understand that risk.\n\nAnd here is why we are confident that this vendor\n\nwill meet our security guidelines and we approve this supplier.\n\nUltimately, at the end of the day, what we're looking to do is to approve\n\nvendors by doing these security assessments\n\nand be a lot more timely and effective and efficient in doing that.\n\nSo having that automated way of, you know, not just automating the process,\n\nbut automating the collation and production of the work product,\n\nthat's a step that is often overlooked but very, very critical.\n\nAnd finally, step three,\n\nwe've all heard that old adage, hey, don't just trust but verify.\n\nThe UpGuard take on that is don't just automate the trust,\n\nwhich would be that step one, step two piece, but automate the verification.\n\nSo in this kind of scenario,\n\nyou imagine you assess the vendor today and you approve them and all is great.\n\nAnd then\n\ntomorrow they, for just example,\n\nhave some sort of data loss incident that exposes some of your business data,\n\nwhether it be, you know,\n\nin the dark web and the public web and the deep web, wherever it may be.\n\nIf there's no way for either yourselves to know that has happened\n\nor if your suppliers, as is often the case, aren't really thinking to look\n\nnot just now because of being malicious or anything like that.\n\nJust people aren't really thinking about\n\nwhat they don't know they should be thinking about right then.\n\nYou know, I know personally I've seen instances\n\nwhere, you know, I've worked with customers\n\nwhere they've had functional and active passwords that have been,\n\nyou know, just tossed out on the Internet for for 3 to 5 years.\n\nAnd so this can really be a hairball when it comes to understanding, you know,\n\nif there's ever been any incident that came out from that, right.\n\nMore importantly,\n\nyou want to be empowered in these kind of relationships, right.\n\nSo you want to be able to know, hey, supplier,\n\nyou did unfortunately, you know, have an exposure of my data.\n\nHere's the record, here's how it happened.\n\nWhat can we do to move past this?\n\nWhat can we do to work with with you on this?\n\nAnd ultimately being that proactive, empowered\n\nstep of knowing is far superior to just\n\ngoing blind.\n\nMore importantly as well, you want to make sure that any remediation\n\nprocesses are definitely collaborative along those lines.\n\nAnd so quite often, you know, I've seen, you know, a,\n\nyou know, customer of ours have solutions in place\n\nthat allow them to pull a report and then they just send that report\n\nto the supplier.\n\nAnd then the supplier doesn't really know what to do with it.\n\nIt's really important that, you know, not only are you empowering yourself\n\nto automate the remediation of these critical risks,\n\nbut also make life easy on your vendor side,\n\nnot just to be nice, although it's nice to be nice,\n\nbut because it really makes it that much more likely\n\nthat you are going to get that issue resolved.\n\nAnd so keep that\n\nsuppliers through that process\n\nand finally being able to have your board and executive leadership\n\nempowered as well, they need to verify what's going on as well.\n\nSo being able to have some impactful, timely, concise reporting\n\nthat can be produced, whether it's on a recurring and automated manner\n\nthat your executive leadership can consume to inform and guide their strategy.\n\nThat's not only going to be really good for the business, but\n\nalso make you guys look really good, make all of us look really good,\n\nand get more money in this whole little space.\n\nSo we want to make sure that we're looking good, doing good and empowering,\n\nnot just ourselves, not just our vendors, but the business leaders as well.\n\nSo those are the three steps\n\nin terms of what that would look like from a actual solution perspective.\n\nIt's like, oh, all these steps.\n\nLike, is there anyone actually out there doing this today?\n\nWell, coincidentally, yes. UpGuard, us.\n\nWe are doing that today.\n\nSo UpGuard, bringing that step one attack service management component for that\n\npublic facing, you know, risk\n\nmonitoring that's going to be that core capability.\n\nThe security assessment and due\n\ndiligence piece definitely contained in the offering.\n\nReally going to help you automate the questionnaire piece,\n\nthe external evidence collation and the production reports.\n\nI want to make sure we're helping you guys fly right through those vendor approvals\n\nand that third component of data leak management,\n\nmaking sure that if your suppliers or just generally your data\n\nbecomes exposed on the public, deep or dark web, you are able\n\nto get that back in your own control and proactively work with your suppliers,\n\nbuild the strong relationships and supply chains, and finally\n\nmaking sure that your executives are being informed with the appropriate\n\nreporting in a timely and impactful manner so that we can\n\nall ultimately not just automate this third party\n\nrisk, but also be able to manage it effectively. So\n\nI think that's going to be\n\nit for the UpGuard component.\n\nDefinitely keen on taking the questions\n\nas they come, so feel free\n\nto drop them in the Q\u0026A tab.\n\nSeems we have a question about questionnaires\n\nand the potential value for acquisitions.\n\nDefinitely by a little more specificity to that.\n\nIn the meantime, definitely, I know that\n\nin terms of like the mergers and acquisitions,\n\nthere is a significant component of that that is just straight up due diligence.\n\nDefinitely.\n\nI have worked with customers who have inherited a breach\n\nand didn't know it.\n\nThere's yeah, significant incidents have actually happened that way.\n\nAnd so as far as customizing a questionnaire,\n\nyou know, if there is a kind of specific,\n\nyou know, approach that your organization is taking to\n\nmerger and acquisition due diligence, then definitely the customized\n\nquestionnaires are going to be a good way for you guys\n\nto be able to kind of automate that, that custom piece.\n\nOne of the things I would definitely say around mergers and acquisitions\n\nis if you are only working off of a,\n\nyou know, a custom approach to get that security due diligence out of the way,\n\nyou might want to consider pairing it with an assessment\n\nthat does look at a established framework.\n\nYou know, something like ISO 27K1, you know, NEST,\n\nthis is going to be a really good way of\n\njust getting that like broad scope sense of how they're securing themselves.\n\nYou want to look for that external validation\n\nas well, bug bounties, pentests,\n\nbut for for anything that specific to how you approach\n\nor how your business is approaching\n\nmergers and acquisitions, you definitely want to,\n\nyou know, yeah, you can definitely use a custom questionnaire and, and automate\n\nthat workflow.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo in terms of another question, speaking a little bit to,\n\nyou know, what's like the way I'm reading this, what's the value of this\n\nfor a kind of legal, financial,\n\nyou know, C-suite type of user?\n\nSo in terms of legal and finance,\n\nthey obviously have this,\n\nyou know, kind of governance\n\nor a kind of compliance side that is is very important to the business,\n\nbut isn't in the same kind of vein as,\n\nyou know, security or you know, I.T.\n\nrisk would approach it.\n\nBut the worlds are kind of converging.\n\nSo, for example, you know, DPOs,\n\nyou know, data privacy officers really seem to be that current convergence\n\npoint between where legal\n\nand information security start to kind of like merge.\n\nSo from a legal perspective, definitely, you know, this\n\nkind of risk management approach when they're thinking about\n\nhow are we complying with some of these regulations.\n\nMulti-Continental regulations\n\nor multinational businesses in particular have a hard time with being able\n\nto grapple with the the emerging and established regulations out there.\n\nThis is going to be one of those ways that you can definitely assess a vendor\n\nfor any number of these regulations.\n\nSo definitely so far I've seen it be too, too much,\n\nyou know, kind of in purely finance terms.\n\nOn the procurement side, is more about risk management,\n\nbut currently I do see a lot of partnership with security.\n\nSo it's rare still on this could change but you know so far\n\nit's still kind of rare that we see purely procurement people\n\nor finance people looking at a solution like this.\n\nOften they're working with like an rebar or something like that,\n\nand having their workflows run through that.\n\nAnd then our security partner will integrate\n\nsome view from a platform like UpGuard into that system.\n\nAnd then, you know, that's often how I see this kind of working out. So\n\nit seems we may be\n\nup on questions.\n\nCool.\n\nGoing once, going twice.\n\nAll right, cool.\n\nWell, thank you so much, everyone, for coming.\n\nDefinitely excited to take this, my morning,\n\nmaybe afternoon, wherever you may be.\n\nSo signing off now.\n\nThanks for checking out UpGuard and goodbye."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"},"hubspotForm":{"hubspotFormId":"8469d9ee-201a-4f03-933d-0e95f2e52f4c","hubspotId":"228391","hubspotFormSeconds":"122","hubspotFormIsSkippable":"false","on":"true","hubspotFormEnabled":"true","hubspotFormHeaderText":"Want to learn more?"}},"vulcan":true,"branding":"false","showCustomerLogo":"false","customerLogoImageUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/1b2c11a64bb5009d0c284432cc3856f4.bin","customerLogoTargetUrl":"https://UpGuard.com","unalteredStillImageAsset":{"url":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/bee3c85362f65cbded326c28090099dc.jpg","width":"2907","height":"1686"}},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"},"hubspotForm":{"hubspotFormId":"8469d9ee-201a-4f03-933d-0e95f2e52f4c","hubspotId":"228391","hubspotFormSeconds":"122","hubspotFormIsSkippable":"false","on":"true","hubspotFormEnabled":"true","hubspotFormHeaderText":"Want to learn more?"}},"vulcan":true,"branding":"false","showCustomerLogo":"false","customerLogoImageUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/1b2c11a64bb5009d0c284432cc3856f4.bin","customerLogoTargetUrl":"https://UpGuard.com","unalteredStillImageAsset":{"url":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/bee3c85362f65cbded326c28090099dc.jpg","width":"2907","height":"1686"}}},"options":{}};
